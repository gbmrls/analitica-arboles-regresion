1,"Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to 5 players and adds a shorter 5 round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;Die Macher is #1 in the Valley Games Classic Line&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159509.jpg,5,240,14,3,240,Die Macher,240,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159509_t.jpg,1986,Marcus Gschwendtner,"Economic,Negotiation,Political",NA,Karl-Heinz Schmiel,NA,"Country: Germany,Valley Games Classic Line","Area Control / Area Influence,Auction/Bidding,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Simultaneous Action Selection","Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH,Moskito Spiele,Valley Games, Inc.",7.66508,4498
2,"Dragonmaster is a trick-taking card game based on an older game called Coup d'etat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot; is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands.

3,"Part of the Knizia tile-laying trilogy, Samurai is set in medieval Japan. Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha tokens scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each token (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four tokens have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types.

The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks.  A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks.

5,"In Acquire, each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.

10,"Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.&#10;&#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.&#10;&#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.

13,"In Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

The actions are:&#10;- to take a variety of gems from a market stall, &#10;- to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or &#10;- to roll and move again and also collect points.&#10;&#10;The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4-player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on.&#10;&#10;A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards.

It features several characters, represented on actual stickpin buttons, that each have a unique allowance of polyhedral dice.  These dice endow each  character with fairly unique combat abilities.

18,"The robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1000553.jpg,8,120,12,2,45,RoboRally,120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1000553_t.jpg,1994,"Peter Bergting,Bob Carasca,Phil Foglio,Daniel Gelon,Jennifer Lathrop,Paul Sottosanti,Franz Vohwinkel,Peter Whitley","Miniatures,Racing,Science Fiction",NA,Richard Garfield,"RoboRally: Armed and Dangerous,RoboRally: Crash and Burn,RoboRally: Grand Prix,RoboRally: King of the Hill,RoboRally: Radioactive",Robots,"Action / Movement Programming,Grid Movement,Modular Board,Simultaneous Action Selection","999 Games,AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH,Avalon Hill (Hasbro),Hasbro,Play Factory,Wizards of the Coast",7.15355,19371
19,"A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&#10;&#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&#10;&#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&#10;&#10;&#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings.

20,"In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.  Each player has tanks, boats, barges, mining equipment and a base ship at his disposal and will have to contend with the weather and the other miners.  The game uses an action point allowance system and thus is dice free.  Each player on his turn has a pool of points that he can divide in a variety of ways, putting all the points into one unit's movement or dividing them among several units.  Each turn is timed so players have to think quickly, and once a move has been made it cannot be retracted.

22,"From the 2nd edition rulebook intro for MAGIC REALM:&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a game of fantasy adventuring, set in a land filled with monsters, fabulous treasures, great warriors, and magicians. The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.&#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.&#10;&#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.&#10;&#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.&#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.&#10;&#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9&#10;&#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic148345.jpg,16,240,12,1,240,Magic Realm,240,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic148345_t.jpg,1979,"George Goebel,Kim Grommel,Richard Hamblen,Randall C.

41,"In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns. The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1046518.jpg,4,30,9,2,30,Can't Stop,30,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1046518_t.jpg,1980,"Gabriel Laulunen (II),Walter Pepperle,Klaus Wilinski",Dice,NA,Sid Sackson,Can't Stop: Rollin' Down the Highway,NA,"Dice Rolling,Press Your Luck","Asmodee,Borras Plana S.A.,Clipper,Eagle-Gryphon Games,Editrice Giochi,Face2Face Games,franjos Spieleverlag,Miro Company,New Games Order, LLC,Palitoy Ltd.,Parker Brothers,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH",6.85659,9095
42,"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build the bishop's cathedral.

49,"Designer Uwe Rosenberg has a talent for dreaming up new and inventive card games, and Mamma Mia! is a perfect example of this talent, with players placing pizza ingredients into a combined pool, then trying to time their pizza baking in order to make use of what's available in the kitchen.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with eight different pizza orders to fill, with one of those order cards in hand; each player also starts with a hand of ingredient cards (showing pepperoni, mushroom, pineapple, green pepper or olive).

He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.&#10;&#10;Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play.

50,"Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game consists of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in 5 different colors with 3 special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit. There is also a board which functions only to hold and organize discarded cards and is largely superfluous. Games last around 15 minutes. This is generally considered a good &quot;couples&quot; game and is often recommended for people with non-gamer partners.&#10;&#10;The object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the 5 colors. On a player's turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, minus the initial 20, &times;3 for the 2 multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: an expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17.

The game is set in Europe. Each player is provided with a pool of wooden tokens to represent their civilizations.

Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and its current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic239376.jpg,2,150,12,2,150,Rommel in the Desert,150,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic239376_t.jpg,1982,"Ron Gibson,Jody Harmon,Eric Hotz","Wargame,World War II",NA,Craig Besinque,NA,"Block wargames,Desert Theme","Dice Rolling,Secret Unit Deployment","Columbia Games,Game Preserve",7.54068,878

93,"In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic180538.jpg,5,120,12,2,60,El Grande,120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic180538_t.jpg,1995,Doris Matthäus,Renaissance,"El Grande Big Box,El Grande Decennial Edition","Wolfgang Kramer,Richard Ulrich","The El Grande Expansions,El Grande: Grandissimo,El Grande: Grossinquisitor und Kolonien,El Grande: König & Intrigant,El Grande: König & Intrigant – Player's Edition,El Grande: König & Intrigant – Unverkäufliche Sonderkarten","Country: Spain,El Grande","Area Control / Area Influence,Area Movement,Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting,Hand Management,Memory,Simultaneous Action Selection","Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH,999 Games,Användbart Litet Företag,Descartes Editeur,Filosofia Éditions,Gabinete Lúdico,Rio Grande Games",7.80446,18423

96,"Broadsides and Boarding Parties was the first title in Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series of games.  It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea.  There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.&#10;&#10;The second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.&#10;&#10;The components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.  Lastly the board is full color and styled in the period.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note that the first edition was published in 1982 by Larry Harris, Jr. (Citadel Game Systems) and came in a box similar in size to the Games Workshop Ltd. or Avalon Hill games.

From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.&#10;&#10;Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction.

The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning.&#10;&#10;Rules apply to either game:&#10;&#10;Within two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player.

128,"It's really difficult to succinctly describe this game, so take a look at the pictures! Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.&#10;&#10;The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.&#10;&#10;Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3108440.jpg,8,20,10,1,20,Take it Easy!,20,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3108440_t.jpg,1983,"Alexander Strohmaier,Steve Tolley,Franz Vohwinkel","Abstract Strategy,Puzzle",NA,Peter Burley,NA,"Solitaire Games,Take It...",Tile Placement,"Arclight,Burley Games,Cappelen,Cranio Creations,DiceTree Games,Eagle-Gryphon Games,F.X.

Genetically engineered dragons pull trains across dangerous and unexplored territory. Connect cities, fight off forest creatures, and explore the underground to build a railroad empire.&#10;&#10;Based on the Empire Builder system, this fantasy game puts classic building strategy and money management tools in a new venue. Players use erasable crayons on a special board and operate a rail empire. Perfect for an evening of fun and adventure with family and friends.&#10;&#10;In Iron Dragon, probably the most elaborate of the crayon rail games from Mayfair Games, players are set within a fantasy world attempting to create an extensive and profitable rail network.  Players use crayons to draw their rail lines on the game board itself and use their existing rail lines to pick up and deliver commodities for payouts dictated by cards.&#10;&#10;In addition to the standard mechanisms of Empire Builder, Iron Dragon introduces Foremen, which reduce terrain building/river crossing costs depending on their race (elves get a discount in the forest, dwarves get a discount in the mountains, etc.) and Ships, which allow trains to cross the sea between continents, avoid bottlenecks on land, or jump between two unconnected rail networks. Resources are much more segregated by region, with each region specializing in a few resources based on their back story (which is written in the manual).&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3464926.jpg,6,240,12,2,240,Iron Dragon,240,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3464926_t.jpg,1994,"Larry Elmore,Chris Vande Voort","Fantasy,Trains,Transportation",NA,"Darwin Bromley,Tom Wham",Iron Dragon Extensions,Empire Builder Rail Games,"Crayon Rail System,Pick-up and Deliver",Mayfair Games,6.95603,1372

155,"This is a two-trump, trick-taking card game, with several twists.  At the beginning of the game, players draft tasks they intend to complete in order to win the game.  (Tasks include things like &quot;Take no tricks&quot;, &quot;Take 1 Trick&quot;, or &quot;Take No Red Cards&quot;.)  Then, all of the cards are dealt out in front of the players before each hand.  Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to &quot;steal&quot;.  The hand is then played in the traditional fashion, with each player trying to take tricks or not, based on the goal she selected.  The first player to complete five tasks wins the game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    M&#195;&#188; & Lots More&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic274047.jpg,4,60,12,3,60,Was sticht?,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic274047_t.jpg,1993,Ralf E.

Players use different-colored crayons to draw rail from dot to dot, building their rail system.

Use your initial investment to build track.  Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!&#10;&#10;The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.&#10;&#10;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic436693.jpg,6,180,12,2,180,Empire Builder,180,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic436693_t.jpg,1982,"Peter Y.

Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.

Either way, the last family standing is victorious.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.&#10;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.&#10;&#10;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her.

Players are each given an equal set of cards, which they randomly pick a hand of seven.  Each hand one suit is a trump suit, and one suit is a non-trump suit.  Players place one of their cards in front of themselves, and this continues until the hand ends.

Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others.

As the tiles are placed islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, bases, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful discoverer of all. Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Die Neuen Entdecker or Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In 2004, a smaller version of the Entdecker game was released, based on the online version available on the www.playcatan.de site.&#10;         Oceania.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In 2007, the game system was revamped in a new &quot;Entdecker&quot;-series of 3 titles (so far):&#10;         Im Reich der Jadegottin (published 2007)&#10;         Im Reich der W&#195;&#188;stensohne (published 2008)&#10;         Im Reich der D&auml;monen (not yet published)&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic194144.jpg,4,60,10,2,60,Entdecker,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic194144_t.jpg,1996,"Andreas Steiner,Franz Vohwinkel",Exploration,NA,Klaus Teuber,NA,NA,"Area Control / Area Influence,Modular Board,Tile Placement","999 Games,Goldsieber Spiele,Mayfair Games",6.50041,1239
201,"Originally published as Texas by db-Spiele.&#10;&#10;The battle between farmers and ranchers is fairly abstract. A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.&#10;&#10;Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).&#10;&#10;Later republished 1999 as Rosenk&ouml;nig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series.

By tactically moving groups of camels through the different desert grounds and by using its specialties you can rule the desert. -- from the rulebook&#10;&#10;Targui has a board made of large square tiles representing the different types of desert ground. These provide varying economic and strategic value, from 0-5, and with a salt mine in the center, random distribution (with a little tinkering) makes a varied map each game. Players have a village tile which they place on the outer edge, and start with some camels and money. Your turn simply consists of moving and buying camels, expanding your control of the land.&#10;&#10;Targui has very simple mechanisms, and is in effect a simple rolling war game with obvious tactics.

208,"A quick and simple card game for 2-6 milk-drinking players. Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 1-12 in those colors make up the deck.

There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6).

When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, he wins the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one.

Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate.

218,"Players represent collectors attempting to gather sets of valuable properties and artifacts ... coins, antiques, miniatures, etc. These sets are worth handsome sums at game's end. Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.&#10;&#10;These 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.&#10;&#10;There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.&#10;&#10;When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.&#10;&#10;Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:&#10;&#10;1) Purchase properties, as described above;&#10;&#10;2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or&#10;&#10;3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.&#10;&#10;Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.&#10;&#10;As High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic58613.jpg,4,25,12,2,25,High-Bid,25,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic58613_t.jpg,1965,"Aspect Annonsbyrå,Olle Sahlin,Stefan Thulin",Negotiation,NA,"Larry Winters,P.

219,"Players take on the role of club-owners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German.&#10;&#10;Each player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) &amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.&#10;&#10;When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.&#10;&#10;So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (&quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool&quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (&quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!&quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.&#10;&#10;And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).&#10;&#10;There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little.

224,"History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch.  The game board is a stylized version of the globe.  The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events.  Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation.  Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events.  There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few).  Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires.  One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet.  If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch.  Then the next player draws and makes his decision.  The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws.  Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by).  One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called.&#10;&#10;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.&#10;&#10;Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.&#10;&#10;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.&#10;&#10;Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.&#10;&#10;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).&#10;&#10;Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    http://gamesbyemail.com (English, turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic287451.jpg,6,180,12,3,180,History of the World,180,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic287451_t.jpg,1991,"(Uncredited),Charles S.

230,"Merchant of Venus makes players take on the roles of space traders chasing wealth and fortune. Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities.

With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).&#10;&#10;Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159117.jpg,6,180,12,1,180,Merchant of Venus,180,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic159117_t.jpg,1988,"Charles Kibler,George I.

232,"The Theme&#10;&#10;In the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered. The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.&#10;&#10;Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.&#10;&#10;In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).&#10;&#10;During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.&#10;&#10;The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic322925.jpg,4,120,12,2,120,Serenissima (first edition),120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic322925_t.jpg,1996,"Dominique Ehrhard,Guillaume Rohmer,Duccio Vitale","Economic,Nautical,Renaissance",NA,"Dominique Ehrhard,Duccio Vitale",NA,"Cities: Barcelona (Spain),Cities: Genova,Cities: Marseille,Cities: Naples,Cities: Venice","Pick-up and Deliver,Trading","999 Games,Asmodee,Descartes Editeur,Eurogames",6.89152,2092

It presents a conflict between two super-powers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.&#10;&#10;HANNIBAL has been designed by one of the most acclaimed designers in the World, Mark Simonitch. 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants.

Each player becomes one or more pirates and attempts to amass a fortune and retire before a King's Commissioner tracks him down, a Warship stumbles across him, or his own crew cuts his throat! Merchant ships plying the trade routes are the targets. Prizes range from near-worthless supplies to the fabulous Spanish and Mogul treasure ships. Luck, skill and cunning all play a part as you comb the Seven Seas (well ... at least three of them) for fame and fortune.

Players who are ready to strike when opportunity presents itself and are wily and aggressive without being rash will fare best in the long run.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players take up the roles of famous pirates navigating the major sea lanes during the golden age of piracy.

Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round.&#10;&#10;If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President. And someone is sent to the firing squad.&#10;&#10;Players assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account.&#10;&#10;The game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2497596.jpg,7,240,16,2,240,Junta,240,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2497596_t.jpg,1978,"Larry Catalano,Peter Corless,Stephen Crane,Stefan Dick,James Dunn,Martin Hoffmann,Jon Rettich,Claus Stephan","Bluffing,Humor,Mafia,Negotiation,Political,Wargame",NA,"Eric Goldberg,Ben Grossman,Steve Marsh,Steven Marsh,Vincent Tsao,Nikola Vrtis",Junta Expansion Cards,NA,"Area Movement,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Simultaneous Action Selection,Trading,Variable Player Powers,Voting","Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG),ASS Altenburger Spielkarten,Borras Plana S.A.,Creative Wargames Workshop,Descartes Editeur,Ediciones MasQueOca,Hobby Japan,Matagot,Pegasus Spiele,Purgatory Publishing, Inc.,Schmidt Spiele,The Toy Company Argentina S.R.L.,West End Games",6.76122,4450
243,"Advanced Squad Leader is the completely reorganized and re-designed version of the original Squad Leader system. While ASL is &quot;advanced,&quot; it actually is a simpler game than the original Squad Leader became after the three follow-on gamettes. This three-ring binder is the basic rules for the entire system, and provides the ultimate combination of playability and detail. Full-color charts and beautiful pictures make this the most readable of rulebooks - and includes a full-service index as well for quick reference.&#10;&#10;And ASL is more than &quot;squads&quot; - the system includes the rules for everything from machine guns to bazookas, tanks and ordnance weapons, paratrooper drops, glider landings and beach assaults. And much more. This set of rules is constantly kept up to date by expansions included with the modules.&#10;&#10;ASL goals are scenario-defined, and vary from tasks such as exiting troops off of one edge of the board, to inflicting a certain number of casualty points on the opposing force, to capturing a certain number of goal buildings or areas.&#10;&#10;This is just the rulebook. To start playing the game the newcomer must get, at least, the Beyond Valor: ASL Module 1. There are a great many ASL Modules available. &quot;Core Modules&quot; provide additional rules, units from different nationalities, and additional geomorphic mapboards. &quot;Historical Modules&quot; provide campaign games simulating multi-day battles using actual historical maps rather than geomorphic mapboards, including additional rules, counters, and paper maps. Many modules have dependencies on earlier modules.&#10;&#10;Rulebook contents:&#10;&#10;    Introduction&#10;    Chapters A, B, C, D, H (Design Your Own, German &amp; Russian vehicle notes only), J [1st edition]&#10;    Chapters A, B, C, D, E, H (Design Your Own, German &amp; Russian vehicle notes only), J, K [2nd edition]&#10;    Index &amp; Glossary&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;1st edition additional changes/chapters:&#10;&#10;    chapter E in Yanks: ASL Module 3&#10;    chapter F in West of Alamein: ASL Module 5&#10;    chapter G in Code of Bushido: ASL Module 8 / Gung Ho!: ASL Module 9&#10;    chapter K in Paratrooper: ASL Module 2&#10;    8 revised RuleBook pages  [A 17-18/A 29-30/B 31-32/F 1-2 all marked &quot;92&quot;] in Croix de Guerre: ASL Module 10&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;2nd edition additional chapters:&#10;&#10;    chapter G in Rising Sun: ASL Module 13&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;[Note: this is a description of the ASL rulebook.

Thrill to the dust of chariot races, or the skillful bloodshed of gladiatorial combat. Circus Maximus is really TWO games in one. In the Chariot Race game you pick your team of horses, driver, and chariot car, each of which have special characteristics . . . In Gladiator, you pick up your weapons and step onto the bloodstained sands, simultaneously maneuvering, striking, and waiting for that fatal step that puts you inside your opponent's guard.&quot;&#10;&#10;Battleline's Circus Maximus would later be developed by Don Greenwood and published in 1980 by Avalon Hill as separate titles: Circus Maximus and Gladiator.&#10;&#10;Violent and bloody, Circus Maximus details the chariot races that occurred in ancient Rome.  Eight teams race around the track three times to determine victory.  Players prepare for the race by selecting the composition of their team of horses, their rider's skills, and the type of chariot that will be driven.  Once the race begins the players are free to do as they wish to hamper the other racers including whipping the rider, ramming chariots with scythed wheels, smashing into horses, and running over crashed opponents.  A campaign game of multiple races, in which players have to manage their teams and can increase their income by betting on races, is also possible.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic290698.jpg,8,120,12,2,120,Circus Maximus,120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic290698_t.jpg,1979,"Michael Carroll,Cathy Chastain,Chris White (I)","Ancient,Fighting,Racing",NA,"Don Greenwood,Michael E.

255,"Extrapolated from a short review written by Francois Charton for the SPI Compendium&#10;&#10;A small mini-game picturing the twin battles of October 1806, about 100 counters (a little less in fact), one half regular size map, representing the two battlefields, connected by a series of off-map movement boxes. Game takes about 10 minutes to learn and 1-2 hours to play, high solitaire playability.  The rules are as simple as possible. Units have Zones of control, which cannot be exited. When in enemy ZOC, combat is mandatory. Units may advance after combat. Retreats through ZOCs are forbidden, so you need to surround the enemy to eliminate him.

He follows that up by playing a unit, either German or Allied, that was available in the chosen year and could fight in the chosen environment, and the other players subsequently either pass or play a unit (of either nationality) that meets the same conditions.  When all players have made their selections, dice (sometimes) are rolled and totals are compared to determine whether the Germans or the Allies won.  The player who contributed the most to the winning team gets to decide how the convoy and the opposing enemy ships, which are all worth victory points and possibly an increased hand size, are to be distributed amongst the players who were on the winning side.

Additional money can be earned by building factories in each city, but these are limited in number.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game players will take turns buying and/or using plane tickets to move about the board's nine cities. A number of tickets are displayed in rows, divided into two types: The more expensive scheduled flights which allow you to move directly to the printed city, or move your token a number of city spaces orthogonally on the board. Cheaper charter flights allow movement directly between the two city spaces printed on the ticket. You may buy tickets at any time during your turn, and you are not required to move but must do so before taking any regular actions; you may also use any many tickets in a turn as you wish.&#10;&#10;The regular actions include building hotels and factories. Hotels are built on a u-shaped track. When a hotel is built on a red space the building that is oldest/furthest back on the track is removed.

274,"Guerilla is a multi-player simulation card game. Three to six players vie for control of the government as rebels wage a civil war against those in power. As in real guerrilla warfare, the government forces are handicapped by their inability to separate friend from foe. This &quot;fog of war&quot; is accomplished by a clever dichotomy of goals wherein each player simultaneously commands both government and rebel forces. However, each player is secretly backing either the government of rebel cause and is severely penalized if his &quot;side&quot; doesn't win the hand.&#10;&#10;Consequently, players are always torn between scoring for their &quot;side&quot;, or for themselves, or even sacrificing their own resources for the sake of an opponent who appears to be on their side. But is he? Even when you think you've figured out who is who, the Revolution card can appear to change loyalties and totally cloud the issue again.&#10;&#10;Players score by eliminating opposing forces, manipulating the media and world opinion, or controlling various installations such as the Port or Airfield which grant special abilities to those who hold them. Government air power and armor columns struggle against ambushing guerrilla bands which fade back into the jungle without a trace.

276,"La Guerre de l'Empereur: The Emperor's War, 1805-1815 is a game of maneuver and battle between the forces under Napoleon Bonaparte and six other nations that both opposed and supported him at various times in the years between 1805 and 1815. Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...&#10;&#10;Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.&#10;&#10;The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &quot;Flank Attack&quot;, &quot;Cavalry Charge&quot; and &quot;Assault&quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &quot;Refuse Flanks&quot;, &quot;Squares Formed&quot; and &quot;Reverse Slopes&quot;.&#10;&#10;The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.&#10;&#10;The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic16960.jpg,7,240,12,2,240,La Guerre de l'Empereur,240,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic16960_t.jpg,1997,NA,"Economic,Napoleonic,Negotiation,Wargame",NA,"Nicolas Pilartz,Kevin Zucker",NA,NA,"Area-Impulse,Variable Player Powers",OSG (Operational Studies Group),6.38333,60

278,"Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series.  There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns.

279,"The game consists of a set of cards. The cards have white and black pipes in various six-outlet configurations, and players take turns placing them onto the table.  When a player constructs a completely closed-off section of pipe in their color, he takes all the cards from that section.

Additionally, the cards also have two different floors (which appear underneath the pipes) that can be used to expand the game to a four-player affair.&#10;&#10;The game was re-released in 2002 with a reduced deck (48 cards instead of 120) as part of the Hip Pocket Games series.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic5654.jpg,4,20,10,2,20,The Very Clever Pipe Game,20,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic5654_t.jpg,1996,James Ernest,"Abstract Strategy,Card Game",NA,James Ernest,NA,Hip Pocket Games,Tile Placement,Cheapass Games,6.23604,787
280," Neue Spiele im Alten Rom (or New Games in Old Rome (NGIOR)) is a compendium of games from Reiner Knizia. In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.&#10;&#10;(7 of the games are described below)&#10;&#10;The Wheel of History : 2-5 players&#10;&#10;This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.&#10;&#10;The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players&#10;&#10;This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;Mercator : 3-7 players&#10;&#10;This game is Medici's ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.&#10;&#10;Imperium : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.&#10;&#10;Senator : 2-3 players&#10;&#10;You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.&#10;&#10;Circus Maximus : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.&#10;&#10;Consul : 2-4 players&#10;&#10;This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.&#10;&#10;Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic5886.jpg,7,0,10,2,0,Neue Spiele im alten Rom,0,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic5886_t.jpg,1994,Franz Vohwinkel,"Abstract Strategy,Game System",NA,Reiner Knizia,NA,Ancient Rome,NA,"New Games Order, LLC,Piatnik",6.8104,173

289,"Between 1500 and 600 BC, Asia Minor and the Mediterranean witnessed the rise and fall of several mighty empires. Often the birth of one empire precipitated the death of another.

Each turn (90 years) will see new countries come to the fore, while established empires struggle to levy reinforcements and arrange alliances. A fine line must be walked between conserving one's forces and expanding one's empire. Too much expansion will see your resources spread thin and possibly swept away by a new emerging empire, but not enough aggression will see your empire fail to garner sufficient victory points to win.&#10;&#10;Armies are of a mix of foot and mounted units, along with the occasional leader of note.

300,"There are 69 artifact tiles in the game of Tutanchamun. These are shuffled and then laid out randomly in a long, serpentine trail. Players take turns choosing any tile from the trail, but can never turn back to choose a tile they have already passed. There are 15 different sets of tiles (three sets each of 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1), and when the last tile of any set has been claimed, the player holding the most in that set scores that number of points, while the player holding second most scores half that number. Complicating matters, there are also three tie-breaker tiles and three tiles that let you &quot;buy&quot; a tile from another player. It's an exercise in numbers that plays quickly, probably 30 minutes tops, and is suitable for youngsters yet susceptible to analysis.

301,"Very nice combination of tile placement and betting. Players lay long tiles to build 5 towers taller and taller, whilst betting on which will be the tallest to shortest. The trick is that when you lay a tile to raise a tower one, two or three stories tall, this controls how much you can bet (1,2 or 3 tokens) and crucially, which draw pile you take from (pile 1, 2 or 3). Since the draw piles are face-up, I might want to draw from pile 3 to get a tile which will boost a tower I've bet on, but that means I have to lay a card three stories, and so I might have to play a tile from my hand that helps the other players!

304,"Combination of card play and timing from Wolfgang Kramer &amp; Michael Kiesling. There are some recording artists who are famous for singing certain standards. Players are putting on concerts and use numbered cards for each performer to take control of that singer. The singers are represented by old fashioned 45s, with a disc in the center showing values from 5 to 12. Each time a singer is transferred from control of one player to another, the disc is rotated, so the value can rise to 12, but next move, it drops to 5 again. You try to gain control of an artist at high value, or pass artists from one player to another to make them devalue. Scoring occurs when players choose to put on concerts at the end of their turn, including a gala show which doubles the value.

305,"Early Klaus Teuber game with a well deserved reputation, from a publisher better known for electronic games! The odd combination of mechanisms is a bit tricky to grasp at first, but soon reveals a nice contest. There are various ships in different colors marked on the board and players are dealt 3 random cards to show a share in three of the ships. Also on the board are treasure chests with rising values, and colored markers for each ship move from chest to chest, showing the worth of that vessel. Players begin with cash, 3 Smithy &amp; 3 Trade card, and some lucky horseshoes that they keep on a rack hidden from the other players. These are variously numbered and two dice are rolled at each turn to provide the lucky number.&#10;&#10;As the Flying Dutchman sails the seven seas, it can either move onto islands or the ships. If it is moved onto a ship, players reveal if they are share holders and pay the current value back to the bank as its marker is moved down to zero. On your turn, you can opt to use your Trade card to exchange 2 of your share cards, effectively dodging the Dutchman's threat. Or you can play a Smithy card, to allow you to take horseshoes at the end of the turn. But mainly you can attempt to control the Dutchman's move, by secretly laying down horseshoes to match the lucky number, the closest winning control. A nice rule, if there's a tie, the players are meant to try to agree, then barter, and finally compete with more horseshoes (all to the benefit of the Smithy card players!). Played horseshoes are pooled until Smithies divy them up.&#10;&#10;If the Dutchman is moved to an island, the controlling players reveal a share card and take the value of that ship from the bank. The round ends with all the chest markers moving up once, including a black marker, which ends the game when it reaches the highest chest. Players reveal their share cards and take the final value on the chests, most money wins.&#10;&#10;Puzzling to begin with, but you quickly realize whether your shares are under threat from a Dutchman's move, so you either trade out or try to gain control. If you're not under threat, it may be worth use your Smithy to grab the pool of horseshoes. Get your timing right and the whole thing becomes very rewarding. Simple choices, not perfectly balanced, but the players at times co-operate or struggle, making for an entertaining voyage.&#10;&#10;Winner of the 1992 Deutscher Spiele Preis.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2042135.jpg,6,60,12,3,60,Der Fliegende Holländer,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2042135_t.jpg,1992,Franz Vohwinkel,"Bluffing,Nautical",NA,Klaus Teuber,NA,NA,"Stock Holding,Trading","Bandai,Huki,Parker Brothers,Parker Spiele",6.01538,273

308,"Each game is made up of rounds. A round begins with all players playing one card from their hands and placing it face down on the table. Then, all cards are exposed simultaneously.&#10;&#10;There are 66 City Cards and each carry a name of a city along with a number value (ranging from 2 to 7). Since the trains begin their expansion from the easternmost part of the board, the farther west the city, the higher its number value. Players score points only for City Cards that are played and placed face up. Cards that remain unplayed in hands have no value. The numerical value of a City Card is multiplied by the number of railroads connected to it.&#10;&#10;Players may also play a Double turn Card, a combination of a City Card with a Branch Line card or a combination of a Double Turn Card and a Branch Line Card.&#10;&#10;A Double Turn Card allows a player to place two pieces of track in both track phases of a turn (although only one piece of track may be placed if desired). Furthermore, all bonuses are doubled during the round that card is played.&#10;&#10;Each Railroad has two Branch Line Cards and a player may pay $1 and draw one of them. (Players may only hold one Branch Line Card in their hands at any one time.) If held, the Branch Line Card must be played immediately on the next round in conjunction with either a City or Double Turn Card.&#10;&#10;Play of a Branch Line Card allows a player to start a new route of track for the named railroad from any city that railroad connects, thereby extending the railroad.&#10;&#10;After exposing a card, the round continues with two turns of laying track. Players do not control any specific rail line. Each player can place track on any color provided that the played track connects to an existing corresponding rail network on the board. Once all track is placed, all players replenish their hands (up to five cards). The First Player passes the First Player Train to the player on the left (who becomes the First Player for the subsequent round) and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;The first player to connect the first railroad to any city earns $2. Certain cities are marked with colored squares (matching the colors of certain railroads). Should a corresponding color railroad enter that city, the player making that connection gets a bonus of $4. Double Turn Cards double all bonuses in a round.&#10;&#10;When all track pieces of all the railroads have been played or if a player is unable to play any piece of track because all playable railroads are &quot;dead-ended&quot;, the game ends and points are tallied.&#10;&#10;Points are received in two ways. First, players receive 1 point for each $1 they have. Second, each City Card is worth its value times the number of different rail lines connected to it. The player with the highest total wins!

The Barbarossa scenario also has an early start option with some historically plausible options for allowing this.  The '42 scenario, while historical, is quite imbalanced in favor of the Axis player.  Is a great way to practice the Summer '42 turns though so it is certainly recommended.  Finally is the '43 scenario.  This is imbalanced in favor of the Soviet player and is essentially Barbarossa in reverse.  It is very, very important that players practice this one.  It is the best way to learn the strengths of the Soviet side.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Consolidated Rulebook&#10;&#10;The Avalon Hill Game Company (TAHGC) quickly released a few important errata for the printed game.

334,"Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.&#10;&#10;There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.&#10;&#10;If a 'W' was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.&#10;&#10;When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.&#10;&#10;Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinl&#195;&#164;nder, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic194793.jpg,4,60,8,2,60,Advance to Boardwalk,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic194793_t.jpg,1985,NA,Economic,NA,Charles Phillips,NA,Monopoly,"Area Control / Area Influence,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Take That","Borras Plana S.A.,Editrice Giochi,Parker Brothers",5.35075,626

379,"Building trains is an integral part of America's history. Now the tradition continues with Express, a unique card game for the 90's. Reminiscent of classic card games but including new play twists, Express is as easy to learn as rummy. Players start with one or two car trains and build on their meld to maximize points and bonuses. But players must be wary of train wrecks and derailments. Unique play allows partners to pass key cards to each other during the game.&#10;&#10;The cards represent various train cars, freight, passenger and way, diesel locomotives and disasters.&#10;&#10;Cards are shuffled and dealt to each player, and remaining cards form a draw pile.  Turns consist of drawing either two cards from the face down draw pile or one face up card from the discard pile, melding cards from one's hand and discarding a card.  Players must end their turns with no more than five cards in their hands.  Players meld cards to form freight trains or passenger trains, or they meld individual way cars.  Freight trains are melded so that all the cars are of the same type, such as box car, tank car or auto carrier.  However, a wild card car can be used to have two types of cars in the same freight train.  Passenger trains may contain any or all of the different types of passenger cars.  Each train needs a locomotive which can be any card placed face down.  There is a locomotive pictured on the back of each card.  During the melding phase of their turn, players may exchange face down locomotive cards with any card in their hand.  This feature allows partners to share cards when the game is played by four or six.&#10;&#10;Disaster cards may be played as discards.  They can change the direction of play, allow theft of an opponent's car or wreck an entire train.  Way car cards either absorb the damage of corresponding disasters or remedy them in a fashion similar to the Coup Fourre' of Mille Bornes.&#10;&#10;Hands end when a player or partnership &quot;goes out.&quot;  To do this the player's melds must consist of at least one five car train, one four car train and all other trains must be at least three cars long.

You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.&#10;&#10;Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.&#10;&#10;If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.&#10;&#10;To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.&#10;&#10;If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.&#10;&#10;Comment from the designer &quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. &amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally. It is not just control of a 2-dimensional board but must include the space above and below the playing surface.&quot;&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic175963.jpg,4,20,8,2,20,Polarity,20,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic175963_t.jpg,1986,NA,"Abstract Strategy,Action / Dexterity",NA,Douglas Seaton,NA,NA,NA,"Blue Opal,EKOS,Ekos-USA, Inc.,Ferti,IRWIN Games,Kids On Science, Inc.,Polarity House, Inc.,Tangent Toy Co.,Telemotion Technologies,Temple Games, Inc.",6.41286,1600

383,"Classic Knizia betting and racing game. Initially players bet on the horses as they are dealt from the deck, then the horses race on the die roll, the course being 40 spaces. The cards &amp; die have 4 symbols, jockey's hat, boot, horse shoe and horse's head; the head is on the die 3 times, giving it a 50% chance of being rolled. The cards have different values against each symbol, showing how far they move when that symbol is rolled. But the number against the horse's head is always 1 to 7 for the same horse. So Raven Beauty always has a 50% chance of moving 7 spaces, Lagoon Lady moves 4, and poor old Roamin' Emporer goes 1 space. The trick, and it's a good trick, is that the other 3 values vary wildly for the lower horses, making them outside chances to win. One lucky roll and Roamin' Emporer can leap forward 20 places! So do you bet on the steady goers, or take a gamble on the nags? Players take turns to roll the die and choose which horse moves, so with a good roll you move one you've bet on, with a bad roll you move someone else's horse.

384,"Turfmaster is a horse-racing game for two to eight players, played over a &quot;meet&quot; of three races.  The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).&#10;&#10;Players each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;A round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).&#10;&#10;Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &quot;joker&quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.&#10;&#10;The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.&#10;&#10;The game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the &quot;DeLuxe&quot; version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.

Each deck contains a unique mix of cards, and each deck requires a slightly different playing style to win.&#10;&#10;Mechanics: Each player takes one deck, sets a &quot;base&quot; card on the table, and begins to play. Players play their cards (Hit, Block, Clear, etc.) as fast as they like, trying to win each Base by playing more Hits on their own side. At the bottom of both decks are three Freeze cards.

393,"One of Avalon Hill's family games that appeals to gamers as well.  Players control different expeditions which they equip to explore the Lost World.  Victory is achieved through finding various species of dinosaurs and collecting specimens.  The game comes with a modular board to ensure that no two games are alike, and lots of dinosaur stand-up pieces.  One of the most entertaining parts of the game occurs when a dinosaur chases an expedition back to base camp!&#10;&#10;&#10;This Avalon Hill game has features beyond most family games that appeals to strategy gamers and increase replayability.  First, the board is modular; the location of all the dinosaur sites and required items is completely random every game.  This sort of feature, unusual before the German games of the 90's, puts Dinosaurs of the Lost World years ahead of its time.&#10;&#10;Second, players may influence and interact with other players both indirectly by moving dinosaurs in their path or directly by either trading items amicably or attacking their expedition mercilessly.&#10;&#10;Third-The sharp limits set out in the rules on weapons and ammunition force the players to pick their battles carefully and makes each dinosaur encounter thrilling and high stakes.  Followed strictly, the rules give the dinosaurs a real possibility of winning a combat and requires strategic planning from players if they hope to avoid being chased right out of the game.&#10;&#10;Fourth- The consequences of losing a dinosaur combat are serious.  During the chase you may lose one or more useful tools and even victory points.  Once you escape from the dinosaur, you are returned to camp and lose your next turn.  Because actions that can be taken in camp are somewhat limited, a lost dinosaur battle completely knocks out one turn and diminishes what can be accomplished in two additional turns.&#10;&#10;Finally- The game has excellent style.

The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.&#10;&#10;Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value.  If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.  This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.&#10;&#10;The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players.

Each turn, players select a card from 2 to 10, which is the number of spaces they're moving. After these are revealed remembering that players cannot duplicate a card played by someone previous, players move forward down the road. Each of the cards allows for a certain number of road tile placements from your supply, a number of maneuvers per turn, and the damage your current speed with inflict should you careen into another car. Additionally, a percent of the tiles have special actions associated with them, which give the car on them the ability to jump, or hit a semi-truck, or skid out of control, or just plain slow down 'cuz there's a Smokey comin' on his flipside...

Each player controls one of Earth's factions, each of which is trying to exert power over the planet Thunder's Edge.

The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.&#10;&#10;There are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses.

The 2010 release of the game re-themed what was then called Stimmt So!' to Alhambra: The Card Game, after the popular Alhambra franchise and related, award-winning game Alhambra.  Alhambra, is itself derived from Stimmt So!. The original version of the game, Al Capone, was published in 1992 by a self-publishing company, db-Spiele, which was owned by the game designer Dirk Henn.&#10;&#10;The re-theming of Stimmt So! and Alhambra: The Card Game resulted in the same game with different themes and only minor differences. Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:&#10;1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.&#10;2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.&#10;&#10;Stimmt So! A description of this version:&#10;Using mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation.  There are six &#10;different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.  If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost.  However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on.  After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card.  The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.&#10;&#10;Al Capone  A description of this version:&#10;Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.&#10;&#10;Other versions/re-themes:&#10;Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme.

432,"In 6 nimmt!, a.k.a. Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players.

The similarities end there, though, as Shark is more free-wheeling than Acquire.&#10;&#10;Each player may buy (maximum 5 shares total during the turn) and sell (unlimited) shares both before and after his turn, and during his turn rolls dice to determine which company he can affect and in what region he can place that company's marker.

This wealth is not without risks, though, as placing  in a way that brings two companies' marker-groups adjacent to each other causes the smaller group to be removed from the board, decreasing that company's share price accordingly -- and all players  must pay the amount of the decrease, again multiplied by the number of shares they hold in that company!&#10;&#10;The game ends if all of one company's markers have been used, if one company's share price reaches 15, or all of shares in the game are sold; at which time the players cash out their stock and determine who, with the most money, has won.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic72190.jpg,6,90,12,2,90,Shark,90,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic72190_t.jpg,1987,"A.

It is played on a board with maze tiles (straight, L, and T shaped corridors) randomly arranged on it.  Players are represented on the board by little wizard pawns.  Players are wizards-in-training, and they are charged with exploring the maze and finding all the ingredients (numbered chips) needed to become a Wizard.  The trick is that chips must be claimed in numerical order.  Perhaps the most novel aspect of this game is that players mutate the maze by sliding a tile onto the board from the side, which hopefully will enable them to travel to the next ingredient.  Once all twenty-one items have been claimed, the highest total score wins, but each player also holds a secret recipe worth bonus points if they were able to capture three specific ingredients.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic194789.jpg,4,30,10,2,20,Master Labyrinth,30,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic194789_t.jpg,1991,"Monika Broeske,Andreas Härlin","Children's Game,Fantasy,Maze,Puzzle",NA,Max J.

The players must attempt to find grazing for their cows on the limited pasture.&#10;&#10;Which beef baron will most cleverly play his cards?&#10;&#10;Players have 10 cards to play which specify a number of cows.  Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.  The tricky part starts with the rule that no two players can ever have exactly the same number of cows in a given pasture.  So if you plan to put 4 cows in a certain pasture, but somebody else has exactly 4 there already when your turn comes around, you'll only get to put 3 of them in -- and if somebody else has exactly 3 there already, you'll only get to put 2 of them in.  And it's very detrimental to your gameplan if you don't get to play all the cows you're entitled to!&#10;&#10;When a pasture is completely filled with cows, there are bonuses paid in the form of a chance to put extra cows into other pastures, but perversely, the better bonuses go to the players with the second or third most cows, not the first most.

The mechanism for Hugo's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Hugo, Hugo moves. This means that with more players in the game, Hugo moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.&#10;&#10;Once Hugo has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room!

In the next 4 rounds he tries to build a competitive race car by changing his cards. A race car consists of a coach-work card, a tire card, an engine card and a driver card. After 4 rounds all the players show their race car for that race. The strength is the sum of the 4 played cards. The stronger the combination, the higher your finish place. In case of a tie, the value of the driver decides. Whenever you cannot make a complete car, you cannot take part in that race.&#10; Specials: When your coach work, tires and engine have the same value, the combination is worth 21 points, in spite of their original value. Then you add the value of the driver. When your driver is also of the same value, the total combination is worth 28 points.&#10; Changing: When it's your turn, you can choose on of the following actions:&#10;1.Hand in 1 of your cards (visible) and draw 2 new ones. The new cards can be drawn from the visible cards or from the closed pile. The 4 open piles are sorted by their kind.&#10;&#10;2.Keep all your cards and draw 1 new card.

459,"Using the basic system pioneered in Ave Caesar, this racing game casts the players as race car drivers.  Players use cards to move their cars forward a number of spaces, however the tracks often have 'choke' points where few cars can race side-by-side (not unlike Kramer's Detroit/Cleveland Grand Prix system).  The track is constructed from three double-sided half-boards, which can be combined in a number of different ways for easier and harder tracks.  For the advanced game, each player's movement cards can be divided different ways, depending on the strategy that he wishes to employ for the given track.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic6446.jpg,6,45,10,3,45,Ausgebremst,45,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic6446_t.jpg,1993,NA,"Racing,Sports",NA,Wolfgang Riedesser,NA,"Admin: Better Description Needed!,Sports: Auto Racing",Modular Board,ASS Altenburger Spielkarten,6.92169,225
460,"This is a classic simple railway racing game, perhaps the first modern railroading game, where you draw the railway lines on hex-board. This one uses the sort of colored marker pens you can wipe off with a damp cloth after the game. The game goes through phases; initially you draw tracks and earn money for linking cities. When a number of cities are joined, you start racing, the cities being chosen randomly. The races are simple dice-rollers and the 1st &amp; 2nd place get prize money. After a couple of races, you draw some more tracks, then race some more and so on.&#10;&#10;The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.&#10;&#10;The board has a UK map on one side and a US map on the other, both giving amusing challenges, and the game has good repeat value.

462,"First issued in 1989 for fewer players, the second edition (released in 1996) is for 2-6 players. The board has two sides, for racing either 3 or 4 colored donkeys. Players are given a card secretly, each showing the donkey's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the donkeys. When you move a donkey onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green donkey one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue donkey on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final donkey because it is blocked. Eventually, the donkeys cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins. More of a competitive puzzle than a game, it is a nice diversion, but awkward because the donkeys constantly fall on their sides.

At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!&#10;&#10;In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When&#31; figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.&#10;&#10;The &#31;first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.&#10;&#10;There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.&#10;&#10;The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1798812.jpg,5,90,10,3,90,Inkognito,90,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1798812_t.jpg,1988,"Peter Gifford,Studio Tapiro","Deduction,Spies/Secret Agents",NA,"Leo Colovini,Alex Randolph",NA,"Cities: Venice,Country: Italy","Partnerships,Point to Point Movement,Roll / Spin and Move","Ares Games,Devir,IELLO,Kaissa Chess & Games,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,MB Giochi,MB Spellen,MB spill,Milton Bradley,Piatnik,Planplay,Rio Grande Games,Venice Connection,Winning Moves Germany",6.59832,2364

470,"extrapolated from the preview:&#10;&#10;The essence of the game is that you are moving from one to four pawns around the country, landing in cities, and scoring &quot;votes&quot; in the appropriate state which are proportional to the size of the city. Each turn, you move and add votes to the states you land in.&#10;&#10;There are many complications that can occur. You can sit out a turn and collect money. With money, you can buy &quot;organization&quot; in a state, acting as a multiplier to all subsequent votes you get in that state. You can buy &quot;advertising&quot; - most useful in buying votes in piddly states that you're too busy to visit. You can buy &quot;surrogates&quot; which are additional pawns who may travel, garnering votes, just like your candidate. You can buy &quot;special flights&quot; that help you get to places without the luck of the dice.&#10;&#10;The most characteristic part of the game comes in the &quot;issues&quot;. Each player picks a politician with his own profile on how he stands on various issues. Then either through choice or chance cards, issues become &quot;active&quot;. As long as the issue is active, politicians with a relevant stand will have bonuses or penalties when he visits certain states. The game strongly encourages role playing.&#10;&#10;The climax of the game comes at the end, as you go down each state to see who has the most votes, thereby winning that state's delegates. There is a smart balloting system, in which the lowest scoring player drops out, giving his states' votes to the next strongest in each state. This continues, with players dropping out in each successive ballot until a winner is chosen.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic448261.jpg,6,240,12,3,240,Road to the White House,240,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic448261_t.jpg,1992,Bill Sanders,Political,NA,Jim Musser,NA,Country: USA,NA,Mayfair Games,6.13635,249

475,"Northwest India at the beginning of the 18th century. The rule of the Grand Moguls is waning, and the Maharishis and princes seize the opportunity to take control of the region. By influencing the prominent forces, building magnificent palaces, and ensuring a steady supply of commodities, the princes increase their power until the most successful has won.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to gain the most influence points. These can be obtained by building palaces and by acquiring commodities. A palace can be built after securing the support of the Vizier, the General, the Monk, the Princess, or the Grand Mogul. Commodities are gained by seizing control of a region or by retrieving them on a space where a palace has just been built.&#10;&#10;There are twelve turns with an auction for the region control and the support of the Vizier, General, Monk, Princess, and Grand Mogul, each represented by a different symbol. Players use cards in four colors to bid for the various prizes, and each player may only play one color in any given turn. During your turn you can either increase your bid by playing more cards or withdraw. When you do, you gain the reward for every symbol you have the majority of. You place palaces, gain region tiles, and increase your score accordingly.

478,"In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors.&#10;&#10;The expansion Citadels:  The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion.

Each turn, a player rolls a pair of color dice and chooses one of the showing die colors to perform an action with. Each color is tied to one type of recyclable material. A player can choose to receive a single new recyclable good to his delivery yard, or he can choose to move a single recyclable good from his delivery yard to his treatment area, or he can choose to sell one good from his treatment area to the market grid in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The market grid has 5 rows, and each row can hold only one variety of recyclable materials. When selling to the market, if it is the first time that good has been sold, the player may choose which row to sell into (left-most position in the row only), otherwise he must sell into the next empty space in the row that variety already occupies. He receives the amount of money shown on the space where he places his recyclable good. When the row is full, all goods of that type are removed from the game. The game ends when four of the market rows are completely filled.&#10;&#10;If the player rolls both dice of the same color, he has no choice in which recyclable material to choose, but may perform two actions (delivery, treatment, or sale) with that type of good. In addition, there are two special symbols on the dice (one on each). One is a star symbol, which acts as a wild. The player can choose whatever color he desires. The other is a gavel, which triggers an immediate auction for the type of good shown on the other die, after which the player takes another turn. The auction is a closed-fist auction.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the player's turn, he must pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his delivery yard. He must also pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his treatment area. This provides tension between waiting for bigger pay-outs and selling recyclable materials early.&#10;&#10;The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11672.jpg,4,60,10,2,60,MARK,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11672_t.jpg,1997,Franz-Josef Schulte,Economic,NA,Ronald M.

503,"Each player attempts to score the most points by snaking caravan routes through the desert, trying to reach oases and blocking off sections of the desert. Many people feel that it is reminiscent of Go.&#10;&#10;Publisher's Description&#10;From the award-winning game designer Reiner Knizia comes a game of strategy, patience, and cool plastic camels! The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.&#10; In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.&#10; Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.&#10;&#10;Through the Desert is part of the so called Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic730576.jpg,5,45,10,2,45,Through the Desert,45,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic730576_t.jpg,1998,"John Gravato,Scott Nicely,Brian Schomburg,Claus Stephan","Abstract Strategy,Animals,Arabian",NA,Reiner Knizia,NA,"Animals: Camels,Desert Theme,Fantasy Flight Silver Line Games,Knizia tile-laying trilogy","Area Enclosure,Route/Network Building","Delta Vision Publishing,Edge Entertainment,Fantasy Flight Games,Galakta,Hobby Japan,KOSMOS,Lautapelit.fi,PS-Games,Silver Stars Publishing,Wargames Club Publishing",7.04787,10553

How it happened is clear. A band of corrupt officials have exploited the waning power of the Emperor for themselves.

505,"A clever racing game from Wolfgang Riedesser of Ave Caesar fame.  Players navigate flying dragons from North to South to reach the Golden Volcano.  You start with a set of wind stones marked N, S, O, W, SO, and SW (Ost is German for East).  You get a sloping rack in the shape of a dragon tail and at the start of the game pick the order for your wind stones on your rack, putting one stone underneath your own dragon at its starting position.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you draw the bottom stone from your rack, place it (in the wind direction indicated) next to a dragon on the board, your dragon or another player's, and move the dragon onto your stone.  The stone the dragon had been standing on goes to the top of your rack, to be used again when it rolls down eventually to the bottom.&#10;&#10;You make three moves per turn and try to put the other dragons into tough situations while making progress with your own.  So you generally want to play a North stone to move somebody else and the S, SO, and SW stones for your own dragon -- but there are blocks and corners, so this won't always be possible.&#10;&#10;The main strategic tip is to try to move the dragons that have been left standing on stones with southward movement so as to get the S stones onto your own rack.  You also have two Storm cards (to allow 5 moves instead of 3 on a turn) and two Lightning cards (to prevent another player trying to move your dragon) to deploy during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Although the structural underpinnings and the slight benefit of memory might make you think you're going to have a serious, thinking game, Goldener Drache actually plays out as very light and take-thatty for a fun 15 minutes and &quot;Let's do it again!&quot;&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic294989.jpg,5,30,10,2,30,Goldener Drache,30,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic294989_t.jpg,1992,Dewa Waworka,"Fantasy,Racing",NA,Wolfgang Riedesser,NA,Animals: Dragons,"Action / Movement Programming,Memory",F.X.

The game can be played as a campaign, with new planes becoming available as time passes, and with surviving pilots getting better at what they do.&#10;&#10;Each plane has a maneuver sheet showing which ones it is allowed to do -- some maneuvers can only be executed by ace pilots, and other maneuvers are &quot;restricted&quot; in the sense that they can't be repeated from one turn to the next (the plane would stall).&#10;&#10;If you &quot;tail&quot; another plane, its pilot must show you whether he's going right, left or straight ahead. You get to shoot ahead of your plane, unless you have a bomber with an observer/gunner in the back (swivel-mounted guns). Damage is rolled on a table that determines severity in terms of blue and red hits; you then draw the indicated number of coloued chits from a cup.

525,"from Schloesser session report:&#10;&#10;This is a  trick-taking game, but with enough twists to give it a very different feel. Before each hand, players bid, one at a time, to determine three factors which will affect the hand:&#10;&#10;a) trump colors (primary &amp; secondary) &#10;b) most or fewest tricks &#10;c) whether zero is considered 'high' or 'low'&#10;&#10;Bidding is done by playing cards face-down from your hand. Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.&#10;&#10;After this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points.

These include commodity markets, trading colonies, and warehouses in Amsterdam.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, that player draws three cards and decides how to resolve them for the turn.  A player can either remove the card from the game, keep it for him or herself, or put it up for auction.  The cards allow players to advance or place one of their markers in the various categories.&#10;&#10;There are also time-marker cards which, when drawn, move the game through various &quot;historical&quot; phases until the last which ends the game.  The historical phases follow a period of time in the history of Amsterdam which can range from no effect, to scoring rounds for particular categories, to bonuses, and towards the end of the game to some penalties as wars begin to disrupt business markets.&#10;&#10;The unique twist in the game is that the game comes with a spring-driven auction clock to perform the Dutch auctions throughout the game.  You start the clock and it ticks down as all of the players hold their hands ready close by.  The idea is that as time passes the cost of the card lowers and it is simply an issue of who will pay for it first by slapping down on the clock and thus stopping it at a certain price.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic153968.jpg,5,60,10,3,60,Merchants of Amsterdam,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic153968_t.jpg,2000,NA,"Economic,Real-time,Renaissance",NA,Reiner Knizia,NA,"Cities: Amsterdam,Country: The Netherlands","Area Control / Area Influence,Auction/Bidding,Tile Placement","Jumbo,Rio Grande Games",6.73194,1434

535,"from the general Comment:&#10;This is essentially a card game. Cards come in four basic suits plus a special gray &quot;political power&quot; suit. The cards have values from 5 - 50, with the most cards in the middle of the range. In your turn, you challenge an opponent to a duel in one of the suits. You play a card in any suit (not necessarily the one you are challenging in) , then your opponent plays a card in the same suit. Players can alternately withdraw, or keep going. You then play a different suit - in the same manner, adding up your total score. The suit you challenged in counts double. If the defender withdraws, the challenger places a base (i.e. scores a point) on the defender. If the challenger withdraws, he just finishes his turn without scoring. However, the loser forfeits all cards played (redrawing, but perhaps taking poorer cards), and the winner holds his played cards, and takes the loser's cards into a pool which can score points.&#10;&#10;If no one withdraws after all four suits have been played, players may add gray cards in an attempt to take the lead. Ultimately, a player will pass or run out of gray cards, at which point the high score will win the hand.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic205010.jpg,4,30,10,3,30,Power Barons,30,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic205010_t.jpg,1986,NA,Card Game,NA,(Uncredited),NA,NA,NA,Milton Bradley,5.39224,165

538,"Manager is a deceptively simple game of economics for up to six players. Each player is the manager of one of the six companies, which are supposed to be manufacturers competing in the same market with identical products. (It is strongly hinted that the products are computers.) The player is responsible for setting the sale price of his product, buying machines to automate production, and buying or selling stock in any of the six companies.&#10;&#10;The object of each round--usually--is to charge as much as you can for your product without charging too much more than everyone else. Every turn starts with the players secretly setting the price for their product. The person who has charged the least gets to sell. The one who has charged next-to-least also gets to sell--as long as his price wasn't more than 1,000 DM above the person below him. In fact, as long as there isn't a 1,000 DM gap between one player's price and the next, every player gets to sell. But any player who has charged over 1,000 DM more than his next-lowest competitor--and all players who charged more than him--gets locked out of the market.&#10;&#10;The prices on the stock market vary depending on who got to sell and who didn't. The companies that got shut out of the market lose ground. The companies that sold their product gain, with the one who got the highest price gaining the most.&#10;&#10;There is room for all kinds of maneuvering in the game.

Included in the game are huge maps on large poster-sized sheets, a collection of miniature touring cars (complete with spoilers, hood ornaments, roll-bars and lots of other details), and dice.&#10;&#10;The cars are lined up and the race begins.  Going in order from first to last, players have a choice of rolling one, two, or three dice.  The first die is a special die with only 1's, 2's and 3's on it, but the other two are normal d6.  The dice may be flipped to the opposite face. Before moving the car, the player must commit to the order that the dice will be used. The dice are then used to move your car.  However, if you use a die for movement in a corner that's not rated for that speed, you'll get a driving error.  Depending on the severity, you might have to journey through pit row on the next lap.  Dice showing 2,3,5 allow the car to move diagonally, or else the car must maintain its lane. There is a drafting mechanism that entails following into specially marked spaces.

Each of up to four players or teams uses their own set, so there&rsquo;s no craning around to see the picture at the far end of the table. In fact, spiffy cardboard easels prop up the scenes nicely so they&rsquo;re easier to view.  Everyone loads identical scenes onto their easels and a deck of cards  provides a letter for the round. Everyone gets sixty seconds to write down as many things beginning with that letter as they can find in the scene. Although each word can be used only once - a football and baseball wouldn&rsquo;t count as two BALLS - an object can be used multiple times for different words (e.g., BASEBALL, BALL).  Once time has expired, players read through the lists. Any object on multiple lists scores one point for those who wrote it. Any item unique to a single list scores three points. When all lists have been scored everyone advances to the next scene and a new letter is chosen.

The map board's Solar System Display keeps track of the 4 inner planets (Mercury through Mars) and the 9 larger asteroids along their orbits. The rest of the board is taken up by the various territorial displays; the larger planets are subdivided, plus there is Deimos around Mars, the Moon, L-4 and L-5 around Earth and Mercury's two artificial satellites --for a total of 42 territories.&#10;&#10;Leader Characters each have special powers. Troopers represent the grunts --infantry workhorses and cannon fodder. &quot;Gennies&quot; are Genetically Engineered fighters; they are stronger than Troopers but cannot leave the planet for which they were designed. Transport ships carry troops and factories between planets. War ships come as Fighters and Battlers (i.e., Bombers). Killer Satellites play the role of air defense. Factories make all these pieces - although you do have a Black Market option.&#10;&#10;As the planets move through their orbits you must plan your own moves well in advance to exploit planetary conjunctions. The movement rules consider not only the ship movements in the planet's orbits, but also the respective revolutions of the planets around the sun, and allow players to plan some nice surprises when two planets are near one another, which usually happens only once or twice in the game.&#10;&#10;Upgraded by:&#10;&#10;    Buck Rogers 2.0&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic694341.jpg,6,120,10,2,120,Buck Rogers: Battle for the 25th Century Game,120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic694341_t.jpg,1988,NA,"Comic Book / Strip,Movies / TV / Radio theme,Science Fiction,Wargame",NA,Jeff Grubb,Buck Rogers 2.0,Characters: Buck Rogers,NA,TSR,6.41815,712
549,"Excerpted from a review by Ken Tidwell&#10;&#10;Aerodrome is a miniatures game of aerial combat during World War I. Players take on the role of biplane pilots and tail gunners dog fighting their way through the gray skies of Europe during the war to end all wars. The game is visually appealing and, like many miniatures games, it was easy to project myself into the scenario. The game is played using 1/72 miniature aircraft mounted on radio antennae with a clear acrylic hex base to hold the whole thing upright. The game board is an aerial view of a WWI battlefield marked off in large hexes.&#10;&#10;Pilots and gunners plot out three moves at a time. Each move the pilot chooses from one of eight maneuvers - straight ahead, straight ahead fast, left slip, right slip, right, left, hard right, stall, and Immelman. The slips allow the player to retain their current orientation but slide one hex to the right or left. Ahead fast allows the plane to move two hexes. Ahead, left, right, and hard right allow the plane to change orientation and move one hex in that new direction. An Immelman allows the plane to move forward one hex but completely reverse orientation. A stall allows the plane to stay in its current hex with the current orientation but runs the risk of throwing the plane into a spin. Planes can fly on one of five altitudes. Descent is always possible but planes can generally only ascend when moving forward and trying no wild acrobatics. After movement, pilots may fire on any plane unlucky enough to find itself in their path.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic139628.jpg,12,0,12,2,0,Aerodrome,0,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic139628_t.jpg,1994,NA,"Aviation / Flight,Miniatures,Wargame,World War I",NA,"Stanley Kubiak,Winston J.

550,"Barbarossa, in Italian &quot;red beard&quot; was, according to its inventor, inspired by the fantasy trilogy Die Schule der R&auml;tselmeister (School of the Riddle Masters), in which wizards are devoted to the creation of riddles and riddle solving tournaments. In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated &quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.&#10;&#10;You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.&#10;&#10;Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.&#10;&#10;A later-developed game with similarities to Barbarossa is Cluzzle.&#10;&#10;Re-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.&#10;&#10;Republished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152337.jpg,4,60,12,3,60,Barbarossa,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1152337_t.jpg,1988,"Anders Jeppsson,Anke Pohl,Marion Pott,Thilo Rick,Bernd Wagenfeld","Deduction,Fantasy,Humor,Party Game,Word Game",NA,Klaus Teuber,NA,Play Dough/Clay Games,"Betting/Wagering,Roll / Spin and Move","Alga,ASS Altenburger Spielkarten,Catan GmbH,dV Giochi,KOSMOS,Mayfair Games,New Games Order, LLC,Rio Grande Games",6.41039,1242

552,"Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.&#10;&#10;Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock, but more on that later. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.&#10;&#10;Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.&#10;&#10;Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if a route is completely blocked at both ends - seems pretty rare - so getting one end pinched off can be painful (but isn't it always?). All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic166866.jpg,5,120,14,3,120,Bus,120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic166866_t.jpg,1999,"Herman Haverkort,Tamara Jannink,Joris Wiersinga",Transportation,NA,"Jeroen Doumen,Joris Wiersinga",NA,NA,"Pick-up and Deliver,Worker Placement",Splotter Spellen,6.8486,653
553,"In this light, humorous, and fast-paced card game that parodies geek culture and co-habitation, players are roommates just trying to get through life with as little work as possible.&#10;&#10;At setup each player is dealt a Job card which lists their free time, income, a special ability that they possess and their Slack goal. Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.&#10;&#10;Players take turns as follows:&#10;-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)&#10;&#10;-Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).&#10;&#10;-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.&#10;&#10;-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)&#10;&#10;-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)&#10;&#10;-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.&#10;&#10;-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game.

Each player is given two cities to start with, and is charged with expanding the different aspects of the cities to attract larger populations.&#10;&#10;Players build farms to feed their people, quarries to finance their expansions, marketplaces to allow growth in their cities, and bathhouses to keep their people clean and healthy.

There are a variety of professions such as astronomers, organists and architects. Each is attracted to a particular combination of building, landscape feature, and social freedom.

The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.

586,"Only once in a great while does a game dare to be truly different and abandon old concepts while striking out to chart virgin territory in game design. Rarer still are the instances in which these games succeed in presenting a simulation of unparalleled realism in an easily comprehended and playable format. In UP FRONT, we have just such a game. Gone are the hexes and charts of conventional wargames; replaced by innovative and attractive game components which have distilled a wealth of technical data into one of the most playable, yet detail laden formats ever devised.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game of man-to-man infantry combat set in WWII Europe and is based loosely on the popular SQUAD LEADER game system. Players need not be familiar with any of the various SQUAD LEADER games or rules to play. The basic theory behind the design remains the same; only the mechanics of play differ. UP FRONT is a far simpler adaptation of SQUAD LEADER principles designed to a card game format. Yet, in many ways, the game is more realistic than its predecessor in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published. There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the &ldquo;hexagons&rdquo; of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.&#10;&#10;UP FRONT is a game player&rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, its famous predecessor, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants.

593,"Favoriten is a simple betting/race game with a nifty element of press-your-luck thrown in.&#10;&#10;Five horses are involved in each of three races.  Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.&#10;&#10;That's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. &quot;I'll back the green horse&quot;) the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.&#10;&#10;Eventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).&#10;&#10;The constant wait-and-see is agonizing.  If you back an unpopular horse, you'll watch it lag behind.  If you wait until everyone else is pushing a particular horse, you gain very little for joining the bandwagon late in the game.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic184258.jpg,5,60,9,2,60,Favoriten,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic184258_t.jpg,1989,Wolfgang Steinmeyer,Racing,NA,Walter Müller,NA,Sports: Horse Racing,Betting/Wagering,Walter Müller's Spielewerkstatt,6.38804,158
594,"In Sleuth, a classic deduction game from master designer Sid Sackson originally released as part of the 3M Gamette Series, players are searching for a hidden gem, one of 36 gem cards hidden before the start of the game. The remainder of this gem deck &ndash; with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors &ndash; is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up. Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.&#10;&#10;A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.&#10;&#10;Players track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card. If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win.&#10;&#10;The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game.

606,"from game review:&#10;&#10;The  game is composed of 11 cards. These are numbered 4 through 13 plus 16 and each also bears a number of &quot;pips&quot;. (From one on the 4 card to four on the 16 card.) A round is played as follows: each player is dealt 5 cards with the eleventh card discarded face-up. (Note that this means that you know exactly what cards your opponent holds.) Each turn both you and your opponent secretly select one of their respective cards and reveal them simultaneously. The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared. There are, at most, fourteen card plays in a game and so the game is usually over in two or three minutes.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic618921.jpg,2,5,10,2,5,Pico 2,5,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic618921_t.jpg,1997,Doris Matthäus,Card Game,NA,"Doris Matthäus,Frank Nestel",NA,Animals: Hedgehogs/Porcupines,"Hand Management,Simultaneous Action Selection",Doris & Frank,5.89776,263

610,"Knights of the Rainbow is from FX Schmid USA. The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.&#10;&#10;Players start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player&rsquo;s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.&#10;&#10;Players win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player&rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players&rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s card.&#10;&#10;Honor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Favor&rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.&#10;&#10;A player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent&rsquo;s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game.

619,"In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;&#10;&#10;The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).&#10;&#10;Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.  Play continues until the point goal is reached.&#10;&#10;In the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L.

620,"This game was the first in what has become a very popular trend for wargaming.  The typically hex-based maps were simplified into an abstract system of connected spaces, which are used for army movement and to keep track of who controls the provinces politically.  The armies themselves are greatly simplified, but the general in charge of the army gains much importance through his ratings for combat effectiveness and overall strategic effectiveness.  Typically, dice are used to resolve conflicts between troops, however a deck of battle cards are used instead, which captures the feel of conflict much better and gives approximately the same results seemingly without the bitterness that accompanies skewed die rolls.  And lastly, the overall ebb and flow of the game is determined through the play of strategy cards, which ostensibly mark certain historical events during the Revolutioary War, but each card has multiple purposes depending on which side is attempting to use it.&#10;&#10;A complete game of WE THE PEOPLE includes:&#10;One 16&quot; x 22&quot; Map&#10;50 Round Playing Pieces&#10;14 Rectangular Playing Pieces&#10;66 Hexagonal Playing Pieces&#10;2 Square Playing Pieces&#10;One 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; Player Reference Card&#10;One Rules Booklet&#10;One Historical Commentary Booklet&#10;96 Strategy Cards&#10;64 Battle Cards&#10;13 Plastic General Stands&#10;One 6-sided Die&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic289191.jpg,2,120,12,2,120,We the People,120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic289191_t.jpg,1994,"Stephen Langmead,William B.

The clue-givers bid on the number of words that they can accomplish the feat, with the lowest bid getting the honor of doing so.  If the team cannot successfully name the words in the allotted time and with the bid number of words (or less), then the other team gets the point.

Some commented that the Campaign Game felt &quot;tacked on&quot; to an otherwise excellent collection of scenarios.  General Vol. 23 Issue 4 provided official rules to help with the 2 player Campaign Game.  However, regarding the Naval Rules, an official correction (2nd Edition Rules of '81) would further complicate matters until the game designer released his own update in General Vol. 19. Issue 5.

The game is packaged very efficiently, in a small clear plastic tube, along with a rules sheet and four small flat tokens. Q-Turn is thus highly portable, and can be played on any flat surface, from the lunch counter to an airline tray table.&#10;&#10;The game is played by randomizing the disks and placing them face down on the table in a 4x4 pattern. Tokens are placed at the corners, with the goal being to move your token to the opposite corner and back again before your opponents.

Each type of disk allows a different special action, rotating one or all of the disks a quarter turn, thus changing the available paths across the board.&#10;&#10;A quarter-turn here, and a quarter-turn there, and soon everyone may be headed off in the wrong direction!&#10;&#10;Microbadge&#10;&#10; Buy It&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2931.jpg,4,20,8,2,20,Q-Turn,20,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2931_t.jpg,1999,Alison Frane,"Abstract Strategy,Puzzle",NA,Andrew Looney,NA,Tube Games,Modular Board,Looney Labs,5.02936,157

If they stay, they run the risk of getting no points if the pilot fails. If the balloon does fall, it is placed back on the lowest cloud.

The swamps and ice caps of the Permian are replaced by the blistering deserts of the Triassic. On both land and sea, 96% of the animal species die.&#10;&#10;In the corner of Pangea that will be known as America, small survivors cautiously sniff the post-holocaust air at the dawn of the Mesozoic Era. Some of these unspecialized  quadrupeds have sloppy ever-replacing reptile teeth, these will be the dinosaurs. Others have sculpted &quot;one-shot&quot; teeth, these will be the mammals. The victor in this titanic  ecological struggle will determine the masters of the planet.&#10;&#10;Clearly, the ruling reptiles triumphed since that day, 248 million years ago, and dominated for 170 million years. Only to be overthrown, in what must be the upset of the eon, by the  mammals. Yet the contest is not over.&#10;&#10;American Megafauna pits dinosaurs against mammals in ancient America. The game is designed for two to four players, from  ages 9 to adult, or can be played solitaire. It recreates the titanic contest of these two types of prehistoric beasts from the  Triassic to the present.&#10;&#10;This is a game of ecology, evolution, and DNA. Players start as one of four nondescript archetypes, but can branch out to new species from this basic type by bidding on genotype and DNA cards as they are revealed. For auction &quot;currency,&quot; players use  gene coins from a &quot;gene pool.&quot; DNA cards allow players to create strange animals, from cud-chewing crocodiles with antlers, to  saber-tooth meat-eating camels.&#10;&#10;In the advanced version, the continent of Laurentia is occasionally flooded or glaciated; greenhouse levels change; and the three Milankovich cycles are handled by cards that occur with historical probabilities.

644,"You are Shipwrecked... to survive, you must compete head-to-head in a bid for food, shelter, water, and friends. These entertaining contests require strategy, intuition, and nerve to determine who survives and who doesn't.&#10;   &#10;This is an auction bidding game. Each round, the lead off player flips over a card from the deck which will then be auctioned off. There are also Hidden Resource cards in the deck. When one comes up, players bid for the next card in the deck without knowing what it is!  Each player has 6 bid markers: 3 Pass, 2 Stop, and 1 Strike. Each round of each auction, a player must place one of these markers face down. The first round, the markers are placed in the '5 position'. This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the '4 position'. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last '0 position'. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns.

646,"Pirate's Plunder is a card and dice game in which players take on the roles of pirates and engage in a life of swashbuckling adventure on the high seas.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns.  At the start of the game, each player starts off in a lifeboat.  They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.  When they have a ship, players draw Playing Cards into their hand.  These cards offer maps for treasures, events to modify a pirate's guns and crews, and other ways to bend the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;A pirate's score is reflected by his treasure, which comes from the wealth-laden ships, loot, and hostages in the form of Treasure Cards.  These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.&#10;&#10;Some Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.  Players can also engage other players in battle as well during a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll if they choose to do so instead of drawing Treasure Cards.  Such battles are resolved by comparing dice rolls, which are added to the player's number of guns or crew.  The loser's ship is sunk and the player has to start his or her subsequent turns in a lifeboat.  The winner also takes the loser's unburied treasure.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a pirate has 3,000 or more pieces of eight worth of unburied treasure and makes a successful dice roll to &quot;Sail Home&quot;, thus becoming the winner.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic255082.jpg,6,30,8,2,30,Pirate's Plunder,30,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic255082_t.jpg,2000,NA,"Card Game,Dice,Pirates",NA,"Tray Green,Dawn Payn",NA,NA,"Take That,Variable Player Powers",Hillary's Toy Box,4.58859,64

657,"A pure bluffing game. Each player gets a set of cards numbered 1 to 8 and a playing mat, which goes in front of him or her. The starting player is the Baron and the other players in turn offer him a card face down from their hand, stating the value. Each player must offer an equal or higher value card than the last and the Baron must take the highest card offered or choose between equal offers. The Baron must then decide to Accept or Reject the offer. If he accepts, the Baron puts the card face down on his mat and the turn passes to the next player. But if the Baron decides the player was lying and Rejects the offer, he turns the card over. If the offer was False, the player takes it back to their hand and the Baron gets to dump one of his cards onto his mat. But if it was True, The Baron must take the card into his hand and the player dumps a card face down.

670,"Starship Troopers is based upon the popular novel of the same name written by the dean of science fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:&#10;&#10;&quot;We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.&quot;&#10;&#10;Although the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat&mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:&#10;&#10;&quot;A suit isn't a spacesuit &mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly&mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.&quot;&#10;&#10;With the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as&#10;&#10;&quot; . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.&quot;&#10;&#10;In early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.&#10;&#10;But the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:&#10;&#10;&quot;The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ...&quot;&#10;&#10;As the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units.  Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.&#10;&#10;The game is set up in a &quot;Programmed Instruction&quot; system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. &quot;Flores died on the way up&quot;) to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.&#10;&#10;Warfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race.

Some infantry regiments with their brigade leader are capable of forming brigades, increasing offensive power at the expense of movement. Batteries can be limbered for increased movement at the expense of firepower, or unlimbered with full firepower and limited movement.&#10;&#10;Combat is a modified version of the classic system adopted by the earlier Avalon Hill games.

But only the first player to arrive at the contract's destination gets the payoff for a contract; everyone else with the cargo is now just stuck with unwanted junk, and may have to pay a penalty to dump it. Players can also build bases on the various planets as they move around. Building bases earns the players Prestige, and when a player tries to make a jump to a planet with a base, the jump is an automatic success if the player has the owner's permission. Traders obviously have permission to jump to their own bases, but if they want to jump to an opponent's, they will probably have to pay a fee. And since only one player can have a base on any given planet, bases rapidly become lucrative investments.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic595019.jpg,6,120,12,2,120,Star Traders,120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic595019_t.jpg,1987,"Mark Chandler,Frank Kelly Freas,C.

677,"Before they can roll and move, players must pick a card and present the rest of the players with a nasty choice between two thoroughly unpleasant hypotheticals in categories such as pain, embarrassment, ethics, and ingestion. If the player guesses the majority preference, he gets to move otherwise he must pass. Some spaces allow the player to invent their own awful hypothetical choice. The other players vote secretly on their choice in this case. If the vote is not unamimous, the player can move or send someone else back. Players roll a six-sided die and there are only 10 spaces to the goal so games go very quickly. Typical choices on the cards include, &quot;Would you rather lie naked in a bathtub full of live roaches or dive head first into a pool of tobacco spit?&quot; The answer &quot;neither&quot; is NEVER allowed.&#10;&#10;Variant:&#10;The 2003 version of this game &quot;Would You Rather?&quot; appears to have quite different rules to the above described game.

The current player must try to secretly predict the result of the other players' subsequent open discussion and consensus view.

745,"War of Resistance is a detailed, operational level game which cronicles the second Sino-Japanese Conflict starting on July 7, 1937. Often touted as the true beginning of World War II, this 8 year war is the culmination of a decade of aggressive Japanese policy in northern and central China. The game covers the conflict through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.&#10;The Chinese theatre is neither trivial nor inconsequential to the progress and outcome of World War II on a global scale. Over one million soldiers on each side perished. It is estimated that another 7.5 million Chinese civilians died. Over 40 million Chinese were left homeless. The vast majority of Japanese ground combat and support soldiers were engaged in China, preventing their use against the western Allies in the Pacific. America's material dominance may have been the decisive factor contributing to the Japanese demise, but Japan was already doomed to failure in the Chinese quagmire. This is essential to the greater understanding of the war in the Pacific.&#10;Western nations tend to ignore and forget the Chinese contribution to the war effort. It is an indication of western arrogance that World War II is considered to have started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937. The Chinese war effort was far from stellar, but it was enormous. The immensity of the conflict sapped the Japanese war machine to exhaustion.&#10;War of Resistance is a two-player game, with one player representing the military high command of the Japanese forces and their puppet allies, and the other the fractured Chinese military forces. The Japanese player must force the collapse of the Chinese national will to resist. The Chinese player must cling to survival until the entry of the western nations into the Pacific war ensures ultimate victory over the Japanese invaders. Both sides maneuver their forces and conduct combat in an attempt to achieve these goals.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    One rules booklet.&#10;    Two Orders of Battle booklets.

The men who occupied the throne for the next 400 years were a particularly unpleasant bunch, whose main thought was of personal aggrandisement.

In Kings &amp; Castles the players take the part of these men as they pursue their ambitions at home and abroad.

But the first boat is a sinking wreck whilst the fourth boat is a modern speedboat, so the seven must time their run down the path to be last, not first.

Although dice play a part in the game there is plenty of room for skillful maneuvering in the course of each race, which can be from 5 furlongs to 1 1/4 miles.  An important part of the game is provided by certain marked squares: if you can get your horse to stop on one of these it can overtake one horse ahead of it in the same line, which can be vital considering that only two swerves are permitted in each turn (only one if the jockey is an apprentice).  Every horse has a distinctive racing pattern (slow or fast starter, stayer or fader etc.) represented by a set of numbers, one for each turn.  These numbers are added to a single dice throw (common to all the horses), so that the speed of each race can vary substantially.  There are many other interesting factors too numerous to describe in a short review.

813,"This is a game that is a favorite of the kids.&#10;&#10;This game must be assembled inside the game box. Once constructed, it presents a graveyard, with movement spaces, hedges that cannot be crossed, moving tombs, and a crypt containing a headless ghost. The ghost must be defeated in order to win.&#10;&#10;Each player has two character pawns--only one of which they may chose to move on each turn. They move as far as is permitted by the amount shown on their die roll. Also on each turn, the tomb die is rolled, and one of the tombs is moved. This tomb movement alters the playing field by changing what some of the spaces on the game board represent. In this way, a player might land on a square that is safe, but after a tomb is shifted--they suddenly find that they are left &quot;paralyzed with fear.&quot;&#10;&#10;There is complete freedom of movement, except as stated above, and players cannot cross their own path. One of the special spaces is a &quot;Goosebumps&quot; space. On this space, the player draws a Goosebumps card. Some cards require players to perform an action straight away, others allow players to play now or later. One card allows play at any time.&#10;&#10;During the game, players attempt to foil each other by picking up cards that allow them to turn other players into monsters, move other players onto bad spaces, steal each other's cards, etc. After a player has been turned into a monster, they can only be cured by landing on a &quot;magic potion&quot; square. If you are unfortunate, you can also fall into one of the open tombs--that character of yours is then stuck there until the end of the game. Characters can fall into tombs only by the movement of the tomb--In other words, they cannot be moved directly into a tomb.&#10;&#10;Once a player reaches the crypt, they may attempt to defeat the headless ghost. In order to do so, they first must have picked up a ring card. At the crypt, the player drops the skull down the chute--if it falls the right way, then the headless ghosts springs into the air and the player wins.

During the game, players travel backwards and forwards through history, doing all those things people have always dreamed of using a time machine to do: Visiting the great moments of the past, peeking into the future, collecting up impossible artifacts and priceless works of art (at the moment just before history records their destruction), coming to grips with the paradoxes of time travel, and of course, changing pivotal events and altering the course of history itself.

Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power.

Progression across the boards is determined by playing cards (many of which represent the characters and items of Middle Earth), and the effects of corruption are represented by a special die.

826,"Cartagena takes as its theme the famous 1672 pirate-led jailbreak from the fortress of Cartagena. Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.&#10;&#10;To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.&#10;&#10;When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew.

827,"In 375 A.D., Attila's mounted Huns overran Europe causing the Germanic tribes in their path to flee and penetrate the outer provinces of the declining Roman empire. In Attila, the players influence the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the Roman empire. The winner is the player who has exerted the best influence on the most successful of the tribes.&#10;&#10;Players have a hand of cards which correspond to the invading tribes. A turn consists firstly of playing a card and placing the matching tribal marker onto an area of the board, expanding from their start areas, then secondly either repeating this or increasing their influence in that tribe. If a province now contains 5 tribal markers in total, war breaks out between the tribes. The basic strength of each tribe is the number of markers there, but each player can add matching cards from their hand to boost this. The weakest tribe is eliminated (or rather, all tribes with the lowest total), leaving the province at peace and with no possibility of further tribal markers being added. Scoring occurs four times during the game at the end of each century; the first century ends after one war, the second after a further two and so on. The player with the most influence in each tribe scores 1 point for each tribe marker, the player in second place scores one point per area the tribe is in (thus if there is only one tribal marker of one sort in each area both 1st and 2nd will score the same). The influence a player gains increases in each century, so large swings in control are possible.&#10;&#10;Players are thus aiming to expand tribes in which they have the most influence (and conversely, are gaining influence in the tribes they expand) whilst at the same time trying to manipulate the timing and provinces where wars happen with a view to protecting their own favoured tribes and eliminating others. Gameplay is therefore not just about playing out as many of 'your' tribes as you can as you will need matching cards to defend with, and in any case may simply not have the right cards in hand. And sometimes you will want to provoke a conflict, for example by adding a tribe you don't have much influence in to finish an area where one of your favoured tribes is strong.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic147372.jpg,5,45,10,2,45,Attila,45,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic147372_t.jpg,2000,Franz Vohwinkel,Ancient,NA,Karl-Heinz Schmiel,NA,Ancient Rome,"Area Control / Area Influence,Stock Holding","999 Games,Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH,Rio Grande Games",6.51186,1478

The above write up is mistaken when it states that &quot;For The People&quot; is based on &quot;Hannibal v Rome&quot;, but was my second game in the &quot;We The People&quot; genre that I created. The game dropped my battle card system in lieu of a more traditional combat results table to speed play and increase historical accuracy.&#10;&#10;UPDATE:&#10;The 2006 edition, component description above, was recently released. Other than the use of color in the rules and the play aids, the only difference between this and the 2006 edition is I added some variant rules to the rulebook. This rulebook is available from GMT games as a free download.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1736659.jpg,2,360,12,2,360,For the People,360,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1736659_t.jpg,1998,"Rodger B.

840,"Corsairs is essentially a card game where players attempt to assemble the correct combination of provisions in order to be able to board galleys, whilst possessing a strong enough crew in order to board the ship and fend off their opponents potential counterattacks. The game comes with 30 galleys tiles in five different colors. Four of these galleys are placed face-up on the table and are ripe for the taking. Each galley indicates the combination of provisions which must be played before a player can attempt to board it. In addition, each galley indicates the victory points it is worth, as well as the 'boarding' strength, which must be met or exceeded for it to fall prey to the pirates.&#10;&#10;Players are each dealt an initial hand of six cards, most of which depict one of six different types of provisions (water, bread, meat, rum, bananas or beans). In addition, several cards depict corsairs (pirates) with values ranging from 2 - 4.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players must play 3 cards. They may play them:&#10;&#10;a) beside a galley to begin amassing provision cards so as to eventually match the provision requirements indicated on the galley. &#10;b) to the discard pile, replacing them with cards chosen from rummaging through the discard pile&#10;c) 'fire a broadside' by playing any card to the discard pile and rolling dice. He may then steal matching provisions placed by the galley by other players.&#10;&#10;Once a player assembles all of the necessary provisions, he can attempt to board the ship. He needs to have enough corsairs, to add to the roll of two dice to beat the boarding value of the galley. Other players may also attempt to board the galley at the same time, and the one with the highest boarding value wins it. The others lose all the cards played next to the galley.

Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.&#10;&#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &quot;megabucks&quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.&#10;&#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.&#10;&#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 1&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 2&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 3&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-published as:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati:  Deluxe Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CCG Version:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati: New World Order&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine Articles:&#10;&#10;    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)&#10;        European Illuminati - New cards.&#10;    &#10;    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)&#10;        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.&#10;    &#10;    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)&#10;        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic55406.jpg,6,120,12,2,60,Illuminati,120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic55406_t.jpg,1982,"Jeffrey D.

The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.&#10;&#10;In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a ton of Settlers-sized hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory.

The game field is set up just like a tennis court, with the requisite lines and a net, and the players volley a soft tufted &quot;tennis ball&quot;.  One player serves the ball, and if it lands within the fair territory, the receiving player checks to see if it fell within their movement paddle space.  That player then moves the center of their paddle under the ball and uses their figure to return the ball, and so on until one player scores by their opponent knocking the ball out of play, or by playing the ball in a space where their opponent cannot reach it within their movement zone.  All of the ball volleying is performed by tensing back the racket of the playing figure, and then releasing it to launch the ball across the net.

884,"In this western themed game, players are looking to drive cattle across the west, establishing towns.  If you don't like the way something is going, you can fight other players for control with your cowboys.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, and shoot those pesky farmers!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  To Start each player receives a set of colored player counters, matching turn order token, and two black action tokens and either $20 or $25 depending on number of players.  The dice are rolled to determine the start player. Each player in turn order will place one of their cowboy counters in a town box of any of the 5 towns on the map until each player has placed 3 cowboys.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players will bid for turn order, take actions and move the turn marker one space.  To bid for turn order each player places an amount of money under their turn order token in current player order.  Players may either raise or drop out.  If a player drops out all money bid so far is paid to the bank and their turn order token is placed in the furthest available spot from start player space on the turn order track.  This continues until one player remains and becomes the start player for the round.&#10;&#10;During the action phase each player will take 1 action in turn order.  After everyone has taken a turn they repeat the procedure.  The actions available are limited in number so turn order is important in doing what a player wishes to do.  Actions available are: Buy Cattle in a town containing their cowboy(s), Purchase more Cowboys, Move Cowboys to different towns, Move Cattle from one town to another, Purchase Buildings or Transport counters in a town, Take a Farmer(reduces income and victory points from Cattle in the town they are placed), or Gunfight.&#10;&#10;There are six different building and transport counters: StageCoach (these earn $1 per cowboy when cowboys are placed in or moved from the town containing the player's StageCoach), Train (this doubles the income gained from all players Cattle in the same town and doubles victory points gained from Cattle at game end),  Bank (earns its owner $2 for each building or transport counter in the same town), Store (earns the owner $1 for each Cattle counter belonging to other players in the town and $2 per Farmer counter in town),  Hotel (earns $1 for each cowboy belonging to other players in same town), Jail (the sheriff in the Jail acts as an extra cowboy controlled by owner that can be added to Gunfights). Cattle and Farmers also earn money for players during an income round.  Each Cattle counter earns its owner $2 UNLESS the town also contains a Farmer (it only earns $1 if this is the case).  Oh, the Farmer and Cowmen can't be friends.&#10;&#10;Gunfights can be started to take over another players Building or Tranport counter, rustle Cattle, rob a Bank or remove a Farmer or Jail.  The player choosing the Gunfight selects the target of the attack.  All Cowboys belonging to each player in the town will be involved.  The remaining player's Cowboys in the town are not involved. However; the owner of the Jail can choose to help themselves, if they are attacking, or they can add the Sheriff to the defender if wished.  Farmers that are attacked defend as a single cowboy.  Banks and Trains both have an intrinsic 1 Cowboy defense in addition to those in town of owner's color.  The player with the fewest Cowboys fires first and immediately removes casualties.  Each 5 or 6 rolled kills a Cowboy.  If the number of Cowboys is tied then firing is simultaneous.  A player may retreat instead of firing by moving each cowboy involved to a different town (only 1 per town) and loses the engagement.  If the attacker wins they take control of the target of the attack and may replace the counter (up to 2 counters if rustling Cattle) with one of their color (except for Banks, Farmers and Jails).  A Jail or Farmer is removed from play and a Bank is robbed.  The successful robber rolls 3 die 6 and takes that amount of money from the owner of the Bank (the Bank remains under owner's control).  If the owner of the Bank cannot pay the full amount (then pays all they have to the robber and the Bank is removed).  Each time a player wins a Gunfight they take a Wanted Counter.  If none remain they take it from another player their of choice.&#10;&#10;Victory:  After taking turns 3,6,9 and 12 income is paid to players as delineated above.  The game ends after round 12.  Victory points are awarded for each Building or Transport counter (1 point per size of town).  So a building in a Town with 4 Building or Transport Counters including itself is worth 4 points to the owning player.  Each Cattle Counter is worth one victory point for the owner.  If a train is in the town each Cattle Counter is worth 2 points.  If a Farmer is in the town Cattle are worth 1 victory point less.  To illustrate, if a Farmer is in same town Cattle counters are worthless unless a Train is also present in the town.  In this case, they would be worth 1 point each.  The player with the most Building/Transport counters and Cattle in a town is considered to control the town and scores bonus points equal to the size of the town (Cattle do not affect town size but do affect control).  The Player with most money gains 5 victory points (2 each in case of a tie).  The Player with the most Wanted counters scores 4 victory points.  The player with most Points wins.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic198418.jpg,5,120,12,3,90,Way Out West,120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic198418_t.jpg,2000,Peter Dennis,American West,NA,Martin Wallace,NA,NA,"Tile Placement,Worker Placement",Warfrog Games,6.16928,639

904,"Reiner Knizia's auction game about producing movies. In four rounds, players bid on chips representing genuine directors, actors, camera, effects, music, guest stars and agents. These all get placed on players' film-strips, to complete the movie production. So one movie might need 2 actors, but no music or effects and so on. As films are completed, the points value is marked and another film-strip taken. There are two parties each round where players get to pick from offers without paying anything. There are bonus points for first films completed and best films, best directors, even worst film.&#10;&#10;The auction is a basic rising offer with passing until one winning bid remains. Players pay into the pot with contracts as money, and the rest of the players share the pot each turn.

934,"extrapolated from session report:&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is based on the legendary necklace of Saba, which went to the grave with its owner upon her death. Sadly, dastardly grave robbers plundered the tomb and the valuable gems which comprised the necklace were scattered across the globe. Now, a wealthy sheik is anxious to reassemble the necklace and present it as a gift to his lovely bride. Players are charged with the task of assisting the sheik, attempting to purchase the many gems at auction and then reassemble the necklace in the proper fashion.&#10;&#10;The board depicts the frame of the necklace, with space for its 36 missing gems. In total, there are 44 gems in the deck, many of which will ultimately prove to be forgeries. Depending upon the number of players, each player receives from 3 - 7 gems to begin the game, along with $20,000. Four gems are revealed from the remainder of the deck and positioned into the frame.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two major phases. During the first phase, players alternate placing a gem up for auction, ala Modern Art. The auctioneer receives the funds from the high bidder, who receives the gem. The winner has the option of keeping the gem, or placing it into the frame. If placed in the frame, the gem earns $2,000 for other gems it touches and those radiating from it in straight lines, including itself. During phase 2, the reward is reduced to only $1,000 per gem.&#10;&#10;Following an auction, the auctioneer has the opportunity to purchase another gem from the deck for $2,000.  &#10;Phase 1 ends when the gem deck expires. Phase 2 then begins with players reconstructing the necklace. In turn, each player places a gem into the frame and earns funds as described above.&#10;&#10;The twist in the game are the rules which must be followed in reconstructing the necklace. The main rules are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The necklace must be symmetrical, with left and right halves containing the same jewels in the same places. All cards appear twice in the game, so what appears on the left side must appear in the same position on the right side. The only exception to this is the center column. Any duplicate pieces are considered forgeries and are worthless. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces of jewelry containing the same type of gem must be placed in uniform columns. Thus, the first gem placed in a column dictates what kind of gem must appear in that same column. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The number of gems on a card can only be one greater than the number of gems on the cards directly above it. &#10;&#10;&#10;Once the first gem is placed in a column, it 'locks' that column AND the corresponding symmetrical column. Only gems which meet the above rules can subsequently be placed there.&#10;&#10;The game ends once the necklace is completed.

937,"1825 is Francis Tresham's &quot;1829 revised&quot; 18xx game. It is released in 3 distinct modules, or units. 1825 Unit 1 and 1825 Unit 2 broadly cover the same area as the 1829 southern board. 1825 Unit 3 covers most of the remainder of England and Scotland, and with unit 2 will cover the same area as the 1829 northern board. Along with the units are a number of expansion kits, which introduce extra money, trains, tiles, companies, and phases. There are currently three, and will be four regional kits, which cover areas of England, Scotland and Wales not included in the three base units.&#10;&#10;The rules are largely 1829 with improvements. Survey parties are now optional, and track is built in much the same way as most other 18xx titles. The stock market is largely the same, but multiple leaps up the market are allowed if dividends are high enough. Trains can now run to, but not through tokened out stations, and company shares become available in &quot;bands&quot; of the same value. All shares in each band become available when one of the companies in the previous band is sold out.&#10;&#10;Play time varies enormously, depending on how much of the game you play. A single unit on its own will last 1 1/2 to 3 hours, and accommodate 2-4 or so players. Multiple units and expansions add to both the number of players and the playing time. Two units and all the expansions should accommodate 3-6 players (7 max. officially) and last for anything from 4 to 8 hours.

A further set is shuffled and placed face down in the centre of a 3x3 grid, representing the nine rooms through which the cabling will flow. Four markers are placed around the edge of the grid and these represent the only points at which the cabling can leave the grid. The top card of the centre pile is turned over and players have to re-arrange their own tiles in front of them to form a valid network, using the same centre tile as displayed and connecting up the four &ldquo;perimeter&rdquo; markers.

At the start of each round, each player lays out 3-5 cards (depending on the number of players) face up in front of him to create his row; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to his row to create his Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.&#10;&#10;Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty his Ligretto stack. If he has a 1 on the top of any face-up stack, he plays it to the center of the table. If he has a 2 of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, he can place the 2 on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play anything, he can reveal cards from the stack in his hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. He can play this top card onto a central pile as long as he meets the rules for doing so.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player empties his Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of his cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in his Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.&#10;&#10;A rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from his Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in his row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1306961.jpg,4,10,8,2,10,Ligretto,10,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1306961_t.jpg,1988,Michael Michaels,"Card Game,Real-time",NA,Michael Michaels,NA,Ligretto,Pattern Building,"ADC Blackfire Entertainment,Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd,Playroom Entertainment,Rosengarten,Schmidt Spiele,Tactic",6.20476,2336

949,"Twixt is a 2-player abstract game invented by Alex Randolph. TwixT is a &quot;connection-type&quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &quot;Connection type&quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.&#10;&#10;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.&#10;&#10;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.&#10;&#10;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.&#10;&#10;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.&#10;&#10;When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic146608.jpg,4,30,12,2,30,Twixt,30,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic146608_t.jpg,1964,(Uncredited),Abstract Strategy,NA,Alex Randolph,NA,"3M Bookshelf Series,Connection Games",Route/Network Building,"3M,Alga,Avalon Hill,Dujardin,Felsberger,Klee,KOSMOS,rhön-plastik,Schmidt Spiele,Selecta Spel en Hobby",6.58231,2004
950,"From the designer Frank Branham: A 4 player partnership trick taking game themed around the Mexican Day of the Dead. (A particular favorite holiday of ours, as Sandi and I were married on that day in Marietta Confederate Cemetery.) It is short (about 30 minutes), and rather brain bending.&#10;&#10;Dia De Los Muertos (Days Of The Dead) is played over three days as you send animals, then children, then adults on to the afterlife. It is a basic trick taking game, except that most cards have an action with them. You play as a partnership, and if your side wins scoring cards (the dead or food), you exchange a card with your opponent. Other cards allow swaps between partners, asking a question, cancelling other cards and so on.&#10;&#10;The first time you play, there's a lot of checking the rules, checking the crib sheet, remembering if you exchange cards. You spend more time figuring the game than playing the tricks. But after a couple of hands, it makes sense and you switch to game-playing mode. And here's where it pays. If you enjoy Bridge, can figure out what you partner signals when they swap a card, can read the deck based on what's been played, you will really enjoy Dia De Loa Muertos. If you don't like Bridge, or can't figure trick-taking games anyway, steer well clear. Rather brain-bending it is.&#10;&#10;The original game has nice native graphics of the dead abroad and has a variant for 3 players.

951,"Football Strategy boils the sport down to play calling skill. The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line &quot;goal line stand&quot; to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for &quot;long gains&quot;, the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.&#10;&#10;Each play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.&#10;&#10;For variety, three types of offense (&quot;pro style&quot;, &quot;aerial game&quot; and &quot;ball control&quot;) are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.&#10;&#10;Simple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the &quot;More Information&quot; screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.&#10;&#10;For those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations.

963,"The Gardens of Alhambra is an abstract influence game from Dirk Henn where each player is represented by plants of a particular color.  Using tiles with all four colors on them, the players place them onto the board in fixed locations.  In doing so, they try to surround victory point markers and capture them.

Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes).  Players themselves are represented by stone figures.  Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.  On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;A big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.&#10;&#10;Game play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.

1032,"B-17: Queen of the Skies is a strategy game which re-creates the early bombing missions and aerial combat of the B-17 (F Model) bombers of the US Eighth Air Force over Europe between November 1942 and May 1943. Movement to targets is through zones. Die rolls and game tables determine appearance, type, and position of enemy fighters. Charts are used to determine if hits are made, where the damage is located, and how serious the damage is.  Game tables and die rolls also determine everything from the bomber's target and formation position to weather, flak, and German fighter opposition as the B-17 makes its way over land and sea to its target.&#10;&#10;The game has a low complexity and typically, the playing time is generally less than one hour after your first few games.&#10;&#10;B-17 is designed to be primarily a solitaire game. The player controls a B-17F Flying Fortress bomber, trying to survive German fighter attacks and drop its load of bombs on the selected target, then return home safely. Optionally, a second player can control the German fighters (to some degree; their appearance is determined randomly, but successive attacks are under the control of the German player).

1035,"A shot disturbs the eerie silence of a deserted city street, punctuated by the frantic footfalls of men seeking cover. One of Kruger&rsquo;s last veteran nco&rsquo;s lies motionless in the street. The remnants of the dead man&rsquo;s squad are nowhere to be seen&mdash;scattered in nearby houses and gutters&mdash;all thoughts the advance abandoned with the stunned demise or their leader...the compulsion for revenge obviously overcome by their instinct for self-preservation. Off to the right, Kruger&rsquo;s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead. The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat of been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building. Obedient their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet. Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong...&#10;&#10;This is Squad Leader...a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe. Now you make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army...for YOU are the Squad Leader. YOU direct the fire against your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armour assaults. Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods? The decision is irrevocable and yours alone. You must live or die by the results.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armoured advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes. A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows you own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability. In addition, a &ldquo;Design You Own&rdquo; section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation.&#10;&#10;Each hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters or real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles of 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into 8 phases equivalent to two minutes of actual time.&#10;&#10;Squad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its innovative system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armoured warfare games. Squad Leader provides innovative rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more.&#10;&#10;Be forewarned!

If he draws a trade, each player buys and/or sells one share to the bank. Players then simultaneously choose one of the two cards in their hand and reveal them. If no one played a bank holiday card, then in turn order, the brick associated with each company card advances on the movement track a number of spaces equal to the movement tile drawn, ignoring occupied spaces.

1038,"Tantrix is a strategy game using painted bakelite hexagons. It was invented in New Zealand, and is clearly derived from the earlier Psyche-paths/Kaliko. Tantrix can be played as solitaire puzzles, ranging from easy to almost impossible, or as a multiplayer strategy game featuring a combination of strategy, luck and skill. Each tile has three tracks on it, in three different colors (out of four colors). Each track starts on one side of the tile and ends on another. The goal of the game is to create the longest line or loop of your chosen color. If you create a closed loop, each tile counts for two points.&#10;&#10;Each player has an open hand of six tiles. When it is your turn, you must first play tiles in any spaces that are &quot;required play&quot; (any hole that has at least three tiles bordering it is a required play). After each played tile, you randomly draw a new tile. Once you've filled all required spaces, you play one tile in any legal space. After that, you once again need to fill required spaces. To play the game well, you need to create required spaces in smart ways. This way you can both enable yourself to play more tiles during your turn and force your opponent to play tiles that continue your track (remember that your opponent's hand is open, so try to create required spaces that take advantage of his tiles).&#10;&#10;The full version contains 56 tiles.&#10;&#10;Note that there are also smaller solo brain teaser puzzles that are Outside the Scope of BGG. The 10-tile version is a color matching puzzle. Arrange the tiles so that all the colored lines match where the tiles touch each other. Additionally, for each puzzle challenge, select one color, and create a closed loop. Begin the easy puzzle by using the first four tiles (which are numbered on the reverse side 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4).

1044,"&quot;Fill Yore Hand ...&quot; with Gunslinger, the game of western gunfights. In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where his shot hits, which combines with his gun to determine the damage he inflicts. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, Smith &amp; Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex. These boards can be assembled in varying ways to create a vast number of different maps that are used in the gunfights. The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.

The goal of the game is to reach the Treasure Chamber in the center of the board and escape back out again with some of the valuable artifacts contained therein.  There are two ways the game can end.  One way is that once someone escapes the dungeon with one of the Warlock's artifacts, they are declared the winner.  The other way is that the players set a time limit.  Once time is up, the game is over and players compare the value of the items they have accrued.  The one with the highest ranked artifact is declared the winner.  If no one has an artifact, then the player with the total highest value in items is the winner.&#10;&#10;Players compete mainly against the board, though player-to-player conflict can happen in two rare instances.

This series of books is similar to the &quot;pick your path&quot; type of adventure books that TSR and many others published around this time (mid 1980's).  Fighting Fantasy was somewhat different in that you created a character and rolled for combat and other effects instead of automatically succeeding in whatever path you chose (like a Tunnels and Trolls solo dungeon).&#10;&#10;Anyway, the game is very similar to Dungeon from TSR.

The object of the game is to travel to the end of the dungeon and open the Warlock's treasure chest.  Along the way players must deduce the correct combination of three keys which will open the chest, and find or steal the appropriate keys.  This is done through a mechanic exactly like Parker Brother's Clue game: you ask players if they have any key cards of a particular number and secretly note down what their answers are.

There are several different businesses, and you can buy parts of them for anywhere from $100,000 each for Residentials, to $600,000 for Casinos.  When someone lands on a property you own, you get $50,000 per property of the same kind you own.  But the big money comess when you collect a full set of property.  Land on a Drive-in Realtor and you can collect multiple millions for selling your set.  There are also Options, which allow you to buy lots from your opponents at nauseatingly low prices, and gold is bought for $600,000 a brick (or in that area) and sells for over $1 million.

Players are big investors (and I mean big - the smallest notes are $50 million and billions of dollars change hands) and wheeler-dealers.&#10;&#10;Players acquire shares in companies, primarily randomly (picked up as cards), but also possibly through purchase of other players' previous sales. To form the companies they must also acquire resources, which are bought from 4 sets. The pricing mechanism for these is like Palmyra and McMulti - each purchase increases the price and each sale decreases it. Once an appropriate set is acquired for a matching set of (at least two) shares in a company, the company can be formed. Companies pay income to their owners each turn. They can also be sold off at a premium, or split up (provided the owner has enough shares and resources) to gain double income. The real heart of the game comes in the option to conduct hostile takeovers. A player lays one or more shares in a company owned by another player and then starts a bidding war to takeover the company. Each player is bidding to buy the shares of the opponent (bids are per share). The &quot;winner&quot; gets the company and all the shares, the &quot;loser&quot; is paid off at the final bid price. Who is actually the winner and loser depends, of course, on the balance of the final price.&#10;&#10;There is a sudden death variable finish, when assets plummet in value, so there is a tense few final rounds when players can try to realize assets while they are still valuable.

Conflict between national wills is more often resolved through peaceful negotiation than through war; but when national honor is too severely tried, war can occur- on a scale that threatens to evolve into the War to End All Wars!&#10;&#10;Time scale = 4 years per turn; Map scale = abstract; Unit scale = Corps/Fleet, Division/Task Force, Regiment/Squadron; Playing time = approx 4 to 7 hours&#10;&#10;Includes 666 counters, 2 22&quot; x 32&quot; mapsheets, 8 player sheets, 1 administrative pad, 2 six-sided dice, 1 counter storage tray, and rules booklet&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic56280.jpg,7,300,12,4,300,Pax Britannica,300,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic56280_t.jpg,1985,"Ted Koller,James Talbot","Negotiation,Political,Post-Napoleonic,Wargame",NA,Greg Costikyan,NA,"Admin: Better Description Needed!,Colonial Theme","Dice Rolling,Voting","Hobby Japan,Victory Games (I)",6.63579,651
1210,"In Cults Across America, you control a bunch of religious fanatics who aim to dominate the entire United States of America. Your faction consists of cultists, priests, creatures, and others, and their plans for domination include such goals as the creation of a continuous chain of lunatics that stretches from coast to coast.&#10;&#10;Cults Across America is not a serious simulation. Rather, it allows players of all stripes to have a good time for a few hours, whether they aim to crush their competitors using deep-thinking strategy, enact improbable religious campaigns, or simply froth, foam, yell, and destroy.&#10;&#10;Three Games in One&#10;There are three different ways to play Cults Across America.&#10;&#10;The Standard Game&#10;This is the normal game. It is intended for players who don&rsquo;t mind taking a few hours to play a game but who like a strong dose of the beer and pretzels factor, even if it means their painstakingly enacted strategic schemes are occasionally foiled by a player who manages to win the Mythos 500.&#10;&#10;The Strategic Game&#10;This is similar to the Standard Game, but removes some of really weird stuff. It allows more conventional board gamers to concentrate on sane strategies and not get too disturbed by wandering madness.&#10;&#10;The Bloodbath Scenario&#10;This is Cults Across America on steroids, and can be played in as little as an hour. The rule set is reduced somewhat so players don&rsquo;t have to get all concerned about resource management and other fiddly details. The victory conditions are simple too: you win by stomping the hell out of anything that&rsquo;s not on your side. Last man (or whatever) standing takes the day.&#10;&#10;Cults Across America has a Cthulhu Mythos theme.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic453845.jpg,6,180,12,2,180,Cults Across America,180,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic453845_t.jpg,1998,Jeff Tidball,"Horror,Wargame",NA,Jeff Tidball,NA,Cthulhu Mythos,"Dice Rolling,Point to Point Movement",Atlas Games,5.67327,361

One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills.

You then flip the identity card over, and draw 2 cards from the draw deck. This is important, because you can only play melds whose suit matches the identity that is currently showing.&#10;&#10;The identity card is important in scoring as well, because any melds that match the identity card when scoring count double, and during scoring if all your meld suits match the current identity card, you shut the other player out!

1331,"Yahtzee meets a board game.  Players move pawns around a board with 12 open spaces and 4 'wild' spaces.  If you land on an open space, you can try to complete one of the 12 standard Yahtzee combinations (not counting the 'Yahtzee' -- more on that later).  If successful, you place the card for that combination on the space and a certain number of your chips to signify ownership.  If another player lands on that space later, they have to match or beat your roll to steal ownership of the board space.  Once a combination has been assigned to a space, it stays there -- so the number of combinations available to fill a blank space on the board decreases throughout the game.  If a player lands on a 'Wild' space, they can try for any combination, then move their piece to the appropriate space and steal ownership.  Also, if a player gets a Yahtzee, they can ignore the space they're on and claim ownership of any space on the board.  Once all combinations have been claimed, each player gets one more turn in which they're allowed to keep playing as long as they keep stealing ownership of a card.

1335,"Gnadenlos! (Merciless!) is a game in which players enter a prospecting boom town and try to accumulate the most prestige points. Rather than doing the dirty work themselves, players hire adventurers to pan for their gold, fight their gun battles, and sit in for them in the poker games. Since the money hasn't yet come in, these rough-tough folk are hired merely with pieces of paper - IOUs. But on pay day the IOUs come due, and if a player can't pay off debts, then the vultures swoop in.&#10;&#10;Players bid for adventurer cards that will be used in various events - Gold Fever, High Noon, and the Poker Game. Each adventurer carries a number (a rating) for each of the three events. When it's time to play out an event, players place an adventurer card face down. All players simultaneously turn the cards over. The adventurer with the highest number pertaining to the event wins; the lowest loses (ties are usually kept as ties, with both receiving the benefits or penalties). In Gold Fever the winner and second highest receive gold, which may be exchanged for prestige points or used to pay off debts. In High Noon, the winner gets to pick back up two IOUs (not necessarily his or her own); the loser is shot and loses the adventurer card. Also the undertaker advances one space along a timing track. In the Poker Game, the winner moves forward on the prestige track; the loser moves backwards. The IOU cards used in bids for the adventurers are placed in rows along the board, each beside one of six dice symbols (showing 1 through 6). When as many rows as there are players in the game are filled, it's Pay Day. A die is rolled and the outermost card beside the corresponding die symbol is turned up. The player who owns that IOU must pay up. This continues until either all cards of one die symbol have been turned up, or a player cannot meet a debt. The unfortunate player in this case gets a vulture chip and moves back 5 spaces on the prestige track. The game ends either when one player has 3 vulture chips; a player reaches or passes the winning space on the prestige track; or the undertaker reaches his final space.

1336,"'Eden is the dream of making arid land fertile. At the outset, the board is a desert. Players play irrigation cards that allow them to place plant tiles in the desert, thus bringing life and fertility to it. As the desert grows, cultivation cards may develop the plant tiles further, making them more valuable and bringing players much manna. The player who first gets tiles valued at 20 &quot;fertility points&quot; on the board wins. But watch out! As the desert blooms competition for the land increases, and other players will try to take your most fertile land away.&#10;&#10;The game play in Eden is simple. Either play one or two irrigation cards to develop areas of desert (i.e. place tiles on the board), or play a cultivation card to increase the value of areas already on the board (i.e. replace existing tiles with more valuable ones, at a cost), or pass. Conflict enters the game when a player places a new tile on the board next to an opponent's existing tile. Then a challenge may be made by the player placing the tile. Manna, the currency in the game, is used in the challenge, which takes the form of a bidding war. Bids, which must be divisible by 5, are always increased. But what the winning bidder actually must pay is the bid MULTIPLIED by the value of the tiles that would be gained. In the case of the challenger, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles sought. In the case of the defender, the winning bid would be the bid itself times the value of the tiles the defender is using in what in effect is an attack. Bids keep rising until one player is unwilling, or unable, to meet the final cost of a bid. The loser forfeits all the tiles involved in the conflict, but gains the value of that land (according to the bid) in manna from the other player.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic293846.jpg,4,60,10,3,60,Eden,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic293846_t.jpg,2001,Bernd Wagenfeld,"Farming,Prehistoric",NA,Gal Zuckerman,NA,Spiele für viele,"Auction/Bidding,Tile Placement",KOSMOS,5.62706,170

1447,"1841 is the apex (or nadir depending on your point of view) of 18xx stock-market manipulation. Set in Northern Italy during a period of rapid political change (borders for playable hexes change twice during the course of the game) the game is one of the most difficult even for experienced 18xx players.&#10;&#10;The greatest innovations center on the ability of companies to own shares in other public companies and the merging of companies. Train obsolescence is rapid and unforgiving, and it is quite possible for forced-purchase trains to be obsolete before they get a chance to run. Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep &gt;1400 for an 8 train - the largest.&#10;&#10;There are 8 historical corporations and eight, named but ahistorical &quot;generic&quot; corporations. These are normally used simply as investment vehicles to maximize the amount of capital available to &quot;successful&quot; companies close to Milan. Northern Italy is mountainous, especially near the off-board Alpine areas and to the South of the map, making progress slow and expensive for the outlying historical companies.&#10;&#10;1841 has a reputation as a very long game, but is not necessarily much longer than games, such as 1870, which have a very large bank. It can be completed in four hours.&#10;&#10;Chris Lawson's game kit is one version that is available and is of his usual high (for a game kit) quality. A large amount of time with scissors and craft knife to cut out the stock and tiles can be expected.  Deep Thought Games now publishes 1841v2 which incorporates changes by Manlio Manzini to address some of the perceived shortcomings with the original which was designed by Federico Vellani with Manlio as a co-author.&#10;&#10;Description by Steve Thomas:&#10;&#10;1841 is the 18xx game of choice for many players, though some hate it. Designed, and originally published as 1839 by Federico Vellani, it is set in northern Italy. The McGuffin here is that 1841 is the 18xx game which is least about actually building a railway and most about manipulating the stock market and managing the extremely fierce train obsolescence. Route development has its place, but unless the players can get the rest of the game about right they are doomed, and it is this which polarizes players' views of the game. When it first became available it whetted the slightly jaded palates of some players since the dividing line between success and abject failure is so narrow. 1841 achieves this by allowing companies to buy and sell shares in each other, and to merge with one another. These factors result in frequent and hard-to-predict changes to the order in which the companies operate. It's exciting and dynamic, and the only real downside, at least for &quot;the financiers who've had enough of the engineers&quot;, to misquote the 1853 box art, is the length of the game. At typically seven hours it cannot sensibly be played in an evening. Even so, the game is usually well worth the investment of time, though it's certainly not for the novice.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic193334.jpg,8,300,14,2,300,1841,300,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic193334_t.jpg,1994,NA,"Economic,Trains,Transportation",NA,"Manlio Manzini,Federico Vellani",NA,"18xx,Cities: Bologna,Cities: Ferrara,Cities: Florence,Cities: Genova,Cities: Mantova,Cities: Milan,Cities: Ravenna (Italy),Cities: Torino,Cities: Venice,Country: Italy","Route/Network Building,Stock Holding,Tile Placement","Chris Lawson,Deep Thought Games, LLC",7.74272,180

1465,"The trick-taking game Wizard uses a sixty-card deck that consists of the traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits) along with four Wizards (high) and four Jesters (low).&#10;&#10;Players compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players, and whoever ends with the highest score wins. In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if a Wizard or Jester (or no card in the final round) is revealed, then the round has no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.&#10;&#10;After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.&#10;&#10;A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic5948.jpg,6,45,10,3,45,Wizard,45,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic5948_t.jpg,1984,Franz Vohwinkel,Card Game,NA,Ken Fisher,"Brettspiel Adventskalender 2015,Wizard: The Christmas Wizards",Wizard,"Betting/Wagering,Hand Management,Trick-taking","(Unknown),999 Games,AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH,Canada Games,Copag - Cia.

More accurate, informative and attractive maps, an increase in the number of unit colors and types, rules substantially revised with an eye to readability, clarity, and historical accuracy, and the addition of new scenarios (and the elimination of some older ones) are just some of the improvements players will find in this thorough revision.&#10;&#10;What You Will Do In Imperium Romanum II &#10;Storm the walls of Rome; plunder provinces; reconquer the Empire; strive for the Imperial purple; war against the Parthians; fight great battles at sea; fight barbarian invasions; mass barbarian hordes to plunder the West; conquer Gaul; cross the Rubicon. &#10;Fight against aristocratic oppression, or for aristocratic stability. Strive to become Rome's absolute ruler, or to defend the republic. &#10;Take the role of Caesar, Pompey, Octavian, Marc Antony, Vespasian, Diocletian, Constantine, Theodosius, Theodoric, Justinian, or Attila the Hun. &#10;&bull; Lead legions, cavalry, horse archers, auxiliaries, and r fleets; distribute donatives to your troops; watch your troops defect because of low morale. &#10;Conspire with other players, and betray them to their foes. &#10;Experience the glory and grandeur that was Rome.&#10;&#10;Suitable for solitaire play. &#10;Some of the 35 scenarios provided can be played to completion in 4 hours or less; others could take as long as 100 hours. &#10;Some scenarios permit as many as 6 players; others as few as 2.&#10;&#10;Imperium Romanum II includes: &#10;&bull; Two full-color maps, total area 22&quot; x 51&quot;, portraying the entirety of the Roman world at 50 miles per hex. &#10;&bull; 800 full-color counters depicting individual legions, auxiliary units, and leaders. &#10;&bull; One 28-page rule book. &#10;&bull; Two 8-page chart booklets. &#10;&bull; One 48-page scenario book including thirty-five scenarios. &#10;&bull; Dice and counter-tray with lock-on lid.&#10;&#10;Design: Albert A.

1497,A collectible card game from Steve Jackson aimed directly at the kids.&#10;&#10;The core game comes with everything you need and boosters just add more options.  Each player gets 10 action points each turn to go back in time and collect dinosaurs.  You start your turn by rolling a die and putting out that many new dinos for hunting.  You travel to different time periods and hunt the dinos by rolling a die and comparing the total to a list on the card.  A good roll allows you to capture the dino but a bad roll can have other consequences including ending your turn prematurely.  Each dino cost variable action points to hunt and moving from one time period to another also costs action points.  You also collect various items that can help you and there are action cards that have good and bad effects.  When the stack of dinos has been exhausted and all dinos have been captured or have escaped the game is over.  Whoever has captured the most dino points wins.&#10;&#10;The beauty of this game is not in game play but the cards themselves.  There is a large picture of the dinosaur and enough info to put a reference book to shame.  As a bonus there is also a phonetic spelling of the name.  Without the special cards this game can be played by 5 year olds with a little help.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.sjgames.com/dinohunt/&#10;&#10;,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic109788.jpg,4,60,8,2,60,Dino Hunt,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic109788_t.jpg,1996,NA,"Card Game,Collectible Components,Prehistoric",NA,Steve Jackson (I),NA,"Animals: Dinosaurs,CCGs (Collectible Card Games),Time Travel",Action Point Allowance System,"Pegasus Spiele,Steve Jackson Games",5.25048,313

How high will you bid before the tension and bluffing get to you? And how good's your eye --- can you spot a forgery when you buy one?&#10;&#10;The MASTERPIECE game combines the excitement of a fast-paced board game with the glamour and sophistication of a game that deals with fine art. Some of the world's greatest paintings, illustrated in full-color postcards, are an integral part of gameplay.&#10;&#10;The high-stakes world of international art --- and the power plays of an auction --- will entertain and enlighten as you join a particularly eccentric group of collectors who've all come in search of a MASTERPIECE.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of an art collector and tries to amass the greatest fortune in cash and the value of art pieces in their collection.&#10;&#10;The painting cards are randomized and placed face down in a stack.  Matching size value cards are also mixed and placed face down in a stack.  These value cards indicate the worth of the painting ranging from forgery (zero) to $1,000,000.  Each player receives an equal sum of money and one painting with value card which are clipped together so that all players can see the painting and only the owning player can see the value.  When paintings are drawn from the stack, a value card is clipped to them in this fashion.  Players move around the board by die roll and land on spaces that allow the player to collect money from the bank, receive a painting from the stack, sell a painting to the bank for its value, sell a painting to the bank for a specified amount, auction one of their paintings to the highest bidding opponent, or auction the top painting in the stack to the highest bidder.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the painting stack is exhausted.

The game is set during the pressure cooker situation of the early 90's and the tension of the game certainly reflects this. Players out-maneuver and out-bluff one another so as to gain the riches of the region, while making sure they spend enough of the &quot;oil/money&quot; to ensure the safety of their state. The tension is kept up by secret deployment of forces and the continual angst of balancing resource spending with the saving necessary to come off the winner. It is, usually, the richest player, the one who has probably spent least on 'defense' throughout the game that will come off the victor. But, the twist is that the game can end in war or peace, and there are different victory conditions depending on which of the two outcomes it ends in.

1512,"This game was originally published by the designer as Bin'Fa under the company name Taoist Arts, Inc. It was released a few years later as Hexagony by Avalon Hill, and then again as Bin'Fa by the designer under the company name Kenterprises. The Avalon Hill version has slightly different rules. Alan Moon is credited with development of this version. Bin'Fa will be re-released February 2015 after undergoing numerous alterations and rule changes from its previous incarnations.&#10;&#10;Bin'Fa/2015 Edition is described by the Publisher/Designer:&#10;&#10;Bin&rsquo;Fa is a game of strategy for 2 to 6 players, each of whom controls an army of twelve units, a general and a supply pawn. In multiple army games, each player controls either two or three armies. The object of the game is to capture the opposing army units by surrounding them, thereby removing them from play.&#10;&#10;The game board is divided into six separate triangles, which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game. Each player places his armies at the start of the game in his home battle sector. The board also contains terrain markers and vortex markers, which the armies can use to jump around and appear unexpectedly behind enemy lines, presenting a sudden and unforeseen threat to the rear.&#10;&#10;The terrain transforms what would otherwise be a featureless playing area into one that more closely resembles the terrain over which actual battles are fought. With an almost incalculably large number of possible different terrain configurations, strategy cannot be decided in advance. The beginner always stands a chance against the experienced player.&#10;&#10;Bin&acute;Fa armies use up supplies when they move just as real armies do. On taking possession of the dice, players must choose between moving their army units on the battle sector (which uses up supplies) or using their turn to move the supply marker in hope of obtaining fresh supplies.&#10;&#10;One of the most exciting aspects of Bin&acute;Fa is the &quot;cavalry charge.&quot; As long as a player has sufficient supplies and is lucky enough to avoid rolling a double, it is possible to send a force dashing across the board to attack enemy units and (hopefully) return.&#10;&#10;The game of Bin&acute;Fa brings together two strands whose origins go back to very ancient times. Sun Tzu was a famous Chinese general and student of warfare. Bin&acute;Fa is based on the precepts contained in his classic work on the subject, &quot;The Art of War,&quot; written 2,300 years ago. They provide the structural framework for the game.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic438376.jpg,6,60,10,2,60,Hexagony,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic438376_t.jpg,1977,"Jean Baer,Ken Hodkinson,Margaret Lehman","Abstract Strategy,Wargame",NA,Ken Hodkinson,NA,Tube Games,Dice Rolling,"Avalon Hill,Kenterprises,Taoist Arts, Inc.",5.82075,133
1513,"The Republic of Rome is an abstraction of over 250 years of history.  It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic.  The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure.

Proposals may include assigning Senators to governor provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents.

1515,"Players take turns forming words on either an 8x8 matrix gameboard (in the current new classic version offered by Winning Moves) or on a 10x10 matrix gameboard (in the currently offered Hasbro Euro edition). Words may be formed horizontally or vertically on the grid, as in Scrabble, but as the title suggests the letters may also be stacked, so already-played words can be changed into different words by having letters stacked (up to a limit of 5 high). EXAMPLE: Change LATE to CATER and then change CATER to BELATED. Scoring is different from Scrabble; there are no prescribed letter values per tile; instead, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted and used as the score as follows: A word that is flat (no stacked tiles) scores 2 points per tile, but the words that score the most are those that have many stacked tiles, with tiles underneath the spelled word also being counted.

1516,"Billed as the Official Game of the United States Auto Club this is one of Avalon Hill's early Sports Illustrated branded games. The game was created by Jim Barnes who sold the game at a booth that he set up at Indy and other race track promenades in the 1970s. Mr. Barnes struck a deal with Avalon Hill and the game was changed a little by the development team at AH and published with the SI logo on the box.  On an oval track you can run up to 33 cars. Each car has its own driver card derived from the performance of the actual drivers of the featured Indy race.

The players do this by Trading, Buying, and Leaping with other cards.&#10;&#10;Monad / Die 1. Million uses a deck of cards with six colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple). Half of these are called &quot;Warm&quot; colors (Red, Orange, and Yellow), and the others are &quot;Cool&quot; colors (Green, Blue, and Purple). The majority of cards has one symbol on them (known as &quot;Commons&quot;), but there is one card of each color with 2-5 colors on them (known as &quot;Bis,&quot; &quot;Tris,&quot; &quot;Quads,&quot; and &quot;Quints&quot;). At the start of the game, each player is assigned one of the six colors as their &quot;identity&quot; and is dealt six Commons and one &quot;Bonus&quot; card (which shows three pairs of colors). The Bis, Tris, Quads, and Quints are placed face up in separate piles in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player attempts to get higher numbered cards into their hand. The easiest way is by &quot;Trading.&quot; To trade, a player turns in a pair of cards with the same number of symbols but of opposite colors (one warm and one cool) and takes the top card from the stack with the next highest number of symbols. When they turn in two Quints, they gain a Monad. If the two cards turned in match one of the pairs on their bonus card, they may also draw the top card from each of the lower stacks. They may also use cards of the same color as their Identity as wild cards, which are treated as having any number of symbols.&#10;&#10;The player can turn in more than two cards and &quot;Leap&quot; to a higher stack. This allows them to select a card with a higher number of symbols. Finally, they can &quot;Buy&quot; a card. Buying cards uses the numbers located on each card. The player turns in a number of cards which total greater than the number on the card they are after. Monads can be purchased for 80 points.&#10;&#10;A player can also draw the top card from the deck but doing so prevents them from taking any other action that turn.&#10;&#10;The first player to accumulate a given number of Monads (which varies depending on the number of players in the game) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the 3M Gamette Series&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1428004.jpg,4,60,10,2,45,Monad,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1428004_t.jpg,1969,(Uncredited),Card Game,NA,Sid Sackson,NA,"3M Gamettes,Sid Sackson Signature Series",Set Collection,"3M,Eagle-Gryphon Games,Hexagames (I),Salagames",6.33359,365

1531,"Depending upon the number of players, each player receives 1 or 2 knights.  Each of these knights lists a series of dice pips on the card, some of which are red in color.  These red numbers are the knights defensive abilities, and he will block these numbers if rolled by an opponent during a competition.  For instance, Upollonius Wolkenburg has a 1, 2 and 3 in red.  Thus, he will block one of each of these numbers each time dice are rolled by an opponent in a competition.  Some knights have less numbers in red, but they usually have a greater attack strength, meaning they can roll more dice in combat.  This mechanism borrows very heavily from many role playing and fantasy games.&#10;&#10;In addition to these 'defense' numbers and the attack dice chart, each knight card also has charts for prizes won (1 - 15) and damage points (1 - 10).  There are also nice illustrations on each card ... about the only kind thing I can say about the game.&#10;&#10;Each player also receives a 'lady' card.  Each lady possesses a number of characteristics, including hair color, build, height and personality.  When granting her favor to a knight (which is indicated by placing a corresponding token onto a knight card), the idea is to seek out a knight who desires similar characteristics in a lady.&#10;&#10;The start player challenges an opposing knight with one of his knights.  A challenge cannot be refused.  These two enter battle, which involves each player tossing a number of dice equal to their attack strength into the tournament field.  In mounted combat, any 1's, 2's or 3's thrown strike a blow, unless these are blocked by the opponent.  If any of these dice strike, the knight falls from his horse and the knight suffers hit points equal to the number of blows which were landed.  If only one knight is struck and falls from his horse, the opponent wins and earns a prize for himself and for his lady.  If both knights fall from their horse, then the match continues on foot.  This involves more dice rolling, but 4's, 5's and 6's now strike.  This continues until one knight concedes or reaches 10 damage points, at which time he is out of the tournament (and out of the game).&#10;&#10;The next player in turn order then challenges a knight.  This process is repeated until there is only one healthy knight remaining. The round then ends and victory points are doled out to the knight and lady who won the most prizes.  There are also potential bonuses which add to the players' scores.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296903.jpg,10,45,10,2,45,Ritter ohne Furcht und Tadel,45,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296903_t.jpg,1998,"Andreas Metzger,Nicolas Neubauer","Dice,Fighting,Medieval",NA,Hartmut Witt,NA,NA,Betting/Wagering,Eurogames,4.29688,64

1534,"The premise is quite simple: jump out of airplanes and get your guys to land as close to the coast as possible. The closer you are to the coast, the more points you score. If you splash down into the water, however, you will score negative points. The further from the shore you are in the water, the more negative points you will suffer. &#10;The board depicts a section of land, followed by a beach and ocean. There is a lake on one space of the land section, and a one-space island in the ocean. The board also has two 'landing' tracks running parallel to each other. The tokens are placed on these tracks once they have leapt from the planes. Finally, the board also has a scoring track to tabulate the points ultimately scored following a round, as well as a cumulative scoring track which runs the perimeter of the board.&#10;&#10;Each player loads his or her tokens (which vary with the number of players) into the two airplanes. There are four rows of seats in the airplanes, and where your tokens are positioned will be important when considering the timing of your jumps. Players then each receive six cards plus one 'jump' card. These cards dictate the actions that will occur during the turn. Most of the cards move one of the planes (red or yellow) forward or backward a certain number of spaces. Other cards allow a player to switch seats in or between the planes, cancel any jump attempts that round or blow a jumper off course a space. Finally, the jump card causes one of the player's token to leap from the plane and land on the space directly below where he was seated.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are quite simple. Each player lays a card face down, and then all reveal their cards simultaneously. Beginning with the start player (which rotates each round), each player carries out the action his card depicts. However, if a player reveals a 'jump' card, then opponents who played a 'wind' or 'cancel jump' card must reveal them, taking the appropriate action. The 'wind' card can be disastrous, as that player gets to bump the jumper one space up or down. This may have the effect of landing the jumper in the water. Cards played are discarded, with the exception of the 'jump' card, which is retrieved back into the player's hand.&#10;&#10;When a token leaps from a plane (due to the play of a 'jump' card), he is placed on the outside track of the landing track. If another token leaps into the same space, it is placed along the inside track. Any other tokens that land on that same space are shoved back to the next empty space on the landing track. This can result in a scoring reduction if the token is being moved further from the coast, but can also be a positive occurrence if this causes the token to be moved onto the land as opposed to falling into the water.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all tokens have jumped from the planes. They are then moved one-by-one to the scoring track, beginning with the token furthest from the shore. There is a positive scoring track for those tokens that were fortunate enough to land on solid ground, and a negative scoring track for those jumpers who splashed into the water. The more tokens that successfully landed on the ground, the more points the players closest to the shore will score. The converse is also true!&#10;&#10;Once all tokens have been repositioned onto the scoring tracks, each player tallies his final results and these are marked on the cumulative scoring track. This entire process is then repeated two more times and the player with the most cumulative points following the third round is victorious.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic7498.jpg,5,45,10,2,45,Jump!,45,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic7498_t.jpg,1998,NA,Aviation / Flight,NA,"Michael Kiesling,Wolfgang Kramer",NA,NA,Simultaneous Action Selection,Editrice Giochi,5.22785,79

A few tight spots exist, so blocking is also an effective tactic.&#10;Tactic cards (you get 5 for the entire race) put a few aces up your sleeve.

The game is typically played on one or more mapsheets or (more recently) mounted map boards, and there are many mapsheet and &quot;hex&quot; (mounted-board) packs available for purchase or even download. Optional rules are also available for hexless play a la many miniatures games. An extensive line of pewter figurines ('Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available in the United States from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure lines in Europe.)&#10;&#10;The main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of core rulebooks, the central one being Total Warfare (in print and PDF), which contains the main (tournament-legal) rules for the game. (The 2011 Catalyst reprint is up-to-date in terms of errata fixes.) TechManual (in print and PDF) contains construction rules for 'Mechs and other units. A series of three &quot;advanced rules&quot; books adds on to the standard rules: Tactical Operations (in print and PDF) covers on-planet actions over a period of hours; Strategic Operations (in print and PDF) covers in-system actions over a period of weeks; and Interstellar Operations (forthcoming; 2012?) covers system-level actions over a period of months. The final core rulebook available is A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG (in print and PDF), a revised version of the BattleTech RPG rules, which have previously gone under the names MechWarrior and Classic BattleTech RPG. A one-volume tome on the BattleTech universe was announced years ago but has no scheduled release.&#10;&#10;BT is also supplemented by a variety of Technical Readouts, which provide gameplay and background data on 'Mechs and other units at various time periods in the game-universe history; map sets, including the new Hex Pack hard-mounted maps with tile overlays; sourcebooks; and pregenerated record sheets, as well as the aforementioned miniatures (which are not required for play).&#10;&#10;As in earlier editions of BattleTech, the current generation includes an introductory box set. The current version (released Q1 2011) is the 25th Anniversary Box Set, which features everything necessary to play the game, including:&#10;&#10;24 unpainted, ready-to-play plastic BattleMech miniatures.&#10;    2 unpainted, premium-quality plastic BattleMech miniatures.&#10;    One 12-page full-color quick-start rulebook&#10;    One 80-page full-color rulebook&#10;    Inner Sphere at a Glance, a 56-page full-color book of universe background and BattleMech technical data&#10;    A 36-page book of pregenerated BattleMech Record Sheets&#10;    One 16-page full-color Painting and Tactics Guide&#10;    Two heavy-duty cards of compiled tables (Many sets came only with one.)&#10;    Two 18&Prime; x 24&Prime; double-sided game-board quality maps.&#10;&#10;In 2009, the adjective &quot;Classic&quot; was dropped from the BattleTech line.&#10;&#10;Introductory Rules&#10;&#10;     Battletech Introductory Box Set&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Core Rulebooks&#10;&#10;     Classic Battletech: Total Warfare (Standard Game Rules)&#10;     Classic Battletech: Tech Manual (Standard Unit Construction)&#10;     Classic Battletech: Tactical Operations (Advanced Ground Rules &amp; Construction)&#10;     Classic Battletech: Strategic Operations (Advanced Aerospace Rules &amp; Construction, Complete Battleforce Rules)&#10;     A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG (RPG rules)&#10;     A Time of War Companion (RPG supplement)&#10;     Battletech: Alpha Strike (Fast-Play Rules)&#10;     BattleTech: Interstellar Operations (forthcoming: 2014?)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Introductory Supplements&#10;&#10;     Technical Readout: 3039&#10;     Record Sheets: 3039 (print version is abridged; PDF is unabridged)&#10;     Classic Battletech Starterbook: Sword and Dragon&#10;     Battletech Hexpack:  Lakes and Rivers&#10;     Battletech HexPack: Cities and Roads&#10;     Battletech HexPack: Mountains and Canyons&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Other Supplements (partial list)&#10;&#10;     Classic Battletech: Dawn of the Jihad&#10;     Battletech: Chaos Campaign&#10;     Classic Battletech Starterbook: Wolf and Blake&#10;     Classic Battletech Map Compilation 1&#10;     Classic Battletech Map Compilation 2&#10;     Classic Battletech: Mercenaries Supplemental&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Rules Expansions for Previous Editions (partial list)&#10;&#10;     BattleTech: CityTech&#10;     BattleTech: AeroTech&#10;     BattleTech: AeroTech 2&#10;     Classic Battletech RPG&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic34098.jpg,20,90,12,2,90,BattleTech,90,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic34098_t.jpg,1985,"Tom Baxa,Tara Gallagher,Earl Geier,Alan Gutierrez,Ernie Hernandez,Jeff Laubenstein,Todd Lockwood,James Nelson","Fighting,Miniatures,Science Fiction,Wargame",NA,"Forest Brown,L.

1544,"Beyond Balderdash is the expanded second edition of Balderdash.  Balderdash is based on bluffing your opponents into guessing your false definitions to obscure words.  Beyond Balderdash adds several new categories to the mix:  Movies (make up a plot), Dates (say what happened on it), People (say what the person did), and Initials (make up what they stand for).  The real answers are often even more outrageous than the bluffs, so the game offers plenty of laughs.&#10;&#10;The UK version of Absolute Balderdash is a different variation with different questions.  Notably, the UK Absolute Balderdash features a &quot;Law&quot; category, where you complete the law given on the card. Beyond Balderdash is lacking that category, and features in its place a &quot;Date&quot; category, where you are given a date and must come up with the historical significance.  The Canadian and Australian versions of Absolute Balderdash also feature the Date category instead of Law.&#10;&#10;Absolute and Beyond were merged into the game Balderdash at least by 2003 (there is a 1997 edition of Beyond Balderdash still with the Dates category).  Now, the vanilla version of Balderdash is the five-category edition with Laws instead of Dates.

The rules are intricate, and there are many factors for players to deal with: resources, unit production, negotiation, and, of course, strategic warfare.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 10&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic147580.jpg,6,1440,14,2,1440,Rise and Decline of the Third Reich,1440,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic147580_t.jpg,1974,"Don Greenwood,Rodger B.

1574,"The hobby of wargaming was born in the 1950s with the publication of the game Tactics. TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called &quot;units&quot; in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).&#10;&#10;The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.&#10;&#10;Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry, armor, mountain, airborne, headquarters, and amphibious troops. Over 100 counters in all.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.&#10;&#10;In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Opera&#195;&#167;&#195;&#163;o MX-1, was released in Brazil.

1577,"Designed to be an educational and challenging game in which players compete primarily with Nature and with each other, luck tends to be an element in the game, but can be overcome by careful play. Because the situation is forever changing, there is no single best strategy; however,players must weigh risks against gains with every decision they make and good judgment will pay off.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a mapboard showing Africa from Khartoum to Capetown and Lagos to Mombasa. The periphery of this map, showing the territory known ca. 1820, is filled-in; the center is blank. A hexagonal grid is superimposed on the map to regulate movement and to delimit territory explored. In the course of play, each player moves a token (representing his explorer) from explored hexagons to blank hexagons one at a time.; terrain, native tribes and other discoveries within the hexagons are then semi-randomly determined, with allowance made for previous discoveries in adjacent hexagons. The player interacts with the discoveries (e.g. negotiates with new natives for guides) and records them on the mapboard using wax crayons. The mapboard surface is erasable. If the explorer dies before returning to Europe to publish his discoveries, all hexagons which only he has explored will be erased and &quot;subsequent explorers will find that his discoveries were only rumors&quot;; i.e., when other players explore the erased hexagons later they will have to generate new discoveries there.&#10;&#10;When explorers do return to civilization, however, they may publish their discoveries, after which they are safe from erasure. Players may also emulate real explorers by withholding some of their discoveries since they will enjoy some advantages when moving through terrain or dealing with natives known only to them. Points are scored for discoveries as they are published and once scored will not be lost if the explorer dies or is retired by his player. A player may retire his explorer at any time and then start a new explorer in Europe.&#10;&#10;Before each trip to Africa, explorers will have to raise money to support their expedition. New explorers with no discoveries to their credit must do this by drawing chance cards for several turns until they feel their finances are adequate. Experienced explorers can accelerate this process by publishing discoveries, which allow them to draw additional chance cards.&#10;&#10;Originally published by Discovery Games and re-published by Avalon Hill as a more card-based rather than dice-based system.

Passenger cards with the pickup point listed are placed in 5 piles. Any player can pickup any passenger showing.

Upon picking up a passenger you also draw a destination card and you must drop off the passenger at that location. The fare is paid out from a chart that is very much like the payout chart in Rail Baron. Fares also pay out a small tip.

During that spring and summer, three independent, but simultaneous, dramas unfolded. In the west, the Japanese launched an all-out offensive to capture Imphal. In the center, the Chindits landed in the Japanese rear area. In the east, the Chinese/US forces moved toward Myitkyina against stubborn Japanese defenses. These battles took place in horrible terrain under the most difficult conditions imaginable with troops whose quality ranged from the world&rsquo;s best to the world&rsquo;s worst.&#10;&#10;Burma contains British, Indian, US, and Chinese troops of varying qualities with ample opportunities for both sides to attack and defend.&#10;&#10;While mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend.

Imphal-Kohima is by far the most interesting ground campaign of the PTO (from an operational perspective), and it's conversion to OCS is remarkably smooth, with a fairly modest set of game-specific rules.&#10;&#10;Unlike some other OCS games, Burma has an excellent range of scenarios, from a couple very short scenarios (1-2 hrs) through to a good selection of longer (6hr) scenarios and on up to 3 monster campaign games (30-60 hrs).&#10;&#10;Scenario Info:&#10;&#10;    Learning Scenario: 1/8th of Map B; 5 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 1 - Operation Thursday: 1/4 of Map B; 9 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 2 - U-Go: 3/4 map of Map B; 10 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 3 - Merril's Marauders: 3/4 map, but requires both maps to play; 24 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 4 - Sato's Dilemna: 1/2 map of Map A; 11 turns&#10;    Short Scenario 5 - Imphal: 1/2 map of Map A; 17 turns&#10;    Campaign Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (which use both maps, obviously); 45, 41, and 31 turns respectively&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 week&#10;Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;Units: Battalion to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory (Burma II - printed 2008):&#10;Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 48-page OCS version v4.0 rules booklet&#10;One 40-page Burma II specific rules booklet&#10;Two 4-sided OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Players: 1 or more (also suitable for solitaire and team play)&#10;Playing Time: 1 to 60 hours&#10;Complexity: High&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Moderate&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic358403.jpg,2,120,12,2,120,Burma,120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic358403_t.jpg,1999,"Nicolás Eskubi,Dean Essig,David Pentland","Wargame,World War II",NA,"Dean Essig,Dave Friedrichs",NA,"Country: Burma,Operational Combat Series","Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter","The Gamers,Multi-Man Publishing",7.86019,287

1588,"The theme of this game is building sheep farms. Each farmer (player) owns a farm consisting of hexes radiating out from the center of the board, and whose boundaries (and therefore, sizes) are initially undefined. The placement of fences -- each of which is shared by the two surrounding farms -- defines the boundaries. Some hexes are clearly going to be in certain farms; others will be fought over (either to acquire or avoid!) fiercely.&#10;&#10;The goal is to complete one's own farm by having the fences on both its sides reach the outer edge of the board before the game ends (without which one cannot win), and to have the most enclosed points among all such completed farms (which wins).&#10;&#10;The sheep are on thick cardboard disks, printed on one side with values ranging from 5 (the best) down to -3. One sheep can fit onto each board hex.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player gets to do one of several actions:&#10;&#10;1) place a sheep blindly from the supply face-down onto an empty board space after secretly looking at it; 2) turn up a face-down sheep tile in place (thereby freezing it for the rest of the game); 3) use the cool wooden sheepdog to blindly &quot;herd&quot; a face-down sheep from one hex to another, where it is then flipped up and frozen; or 4) lay a fence piece on either of the two fences surrounding his farm.&#10;&#10;Certain board hexes, symmetrically distributed, act as multipliers for the sheep that ends up in that space.  There are a few special situation rules and a few rules governing fence placement. There are strong elements of bluff and memory in this game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player's completed farm is filled with pieces (either face-up or down sheep, or the dog). Whoever has the highest number of points on face-up sheep in his/her farm after applying multipliers is the winner.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11968.jpg,6,45,8,2,45,Bauernschlau,45,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11968_t.jpg,1991,NA,"Farming,Memory",NA,Tom Schoeps,NA,Animals: Sheep,Secret Unit Deployment,"Dal Negro,F.X.

1621,"Precursor of the Mutant Chronicles miniatures Game and a kissing cousin of Heroquest stands Mutant Chronicles: The Siege of the Citadel&#10;&#10;Setting: In Mutant Chronicles, players control one of five corporations: Imperial, Cybertronic, Mishima, Capitol, or Bauhaus. Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.&#10;&#10;The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed Corporation player then takes their turn with both Doomtroopers and the next Corporation token is flipped.  Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).  After all Corporations have taken their turns it is the Dark Legion players turn.&#10;&#10;The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.&#10;&#10;Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.&#10;&#10;A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 41# &amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.

Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.&#10;&#10;In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!&#10;&#10;Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with.

Wisdom cards are earned by correctly answering brain teaser questions from the Book of Challenges.  Wisdom cards, in turn, allow a player to obtain an alphabetical clue for that territory.  The four alphabetical clues, correctly unscrambled, form a word related to the medieval theme of the game.  The first player to correctly decipher the word wins the game.

1641,"Bounty is a game for 2 - 8 players from 6 years of age and older. The goal is to make as much money - 'Dubloons' - as quickly as possible! Players start from Home Port as merchants and set out on a trading voyage. By throwing the die, they sail to exotic ports like the Pearl Coast, the Jewel Coast and the Spice Islands. When they arrive at a port they pay a trading fee and draw a card which tells them what cargo they have bought. Cargoes range from codfish and coal to precious spices, pearls and diamonds,!&#10;&#10;Players might also draw a pirate card while trading. They then have to decide whether to rob other players - or continue as honest merchants. Players could also draw a warship card - in which case any pirate who attacks them or anyone else nearby will be in for a nasty shock! The top card in each player&rsquo;s pack shows whether they are merchants, pirates or warships. Since they don&rsquo;t show each other their cards - no-one really knows what they are (until someone decides to turn pirate by attacking another ship).&#10;&#10;Players who are robbed can get their revenge by calling in the Navy and chasing the pirate down before he or she can reach Home Port!

1647,"FROM the SESSION REPORT:&#10;&#10;Each player is competing to pull off the most lucrative scams. You do this by spamming mailing lists. The more closely related the mailing list is to the type of scam you're trying to pull, the easier it is to score.&#10;&#10;Scams come in 4 types - sex, internet, money and free stuff. The text and art flavor are quite wonderful. Of course the sex scams appeal the most - highlights were the Virtual Jellorama, Walter's Wankery and Disgusting Dog Tricks. If you're geeky, some of the internet scams are witty. All the standard 'make money doing nothing' and free stuff scams are there as well.&#10;&#10;You play scam cards in front of you (up to 5) and then play mail-out cards (spams) trying to lure people in. There are a number of mailing lists of various sizes in the middle for anyone to mail to, plus each player has some private mailing lists that only they can spam. The action is to play a 'mail' card, nominating both a scam and the list that you're mailing the scam offer to. If you roll a d6 less &lt;= the size of the list, you succeed, and that scam scores a point. If you roll way under (4 or more), your scam scores 2 points. Some lists specialize in one of the 4 scam types ... if your scam and the list matches, you get a modifier of +2 making it easier to score, plus the mail-out cards have modifiers between 0 and +5.&#10;&#10;Simple so far, but every time a mailing list gets spammed, it decreases in size by 1 (1 million thematically which equals 1 on the die) - these are subscribers getting disgruntled by the amount of spam they're receiving who leave the list.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first person to get 20 points across all their scams, or who gets a single scam of 12 points BUT it's only checked at the start of your next turn.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of 3 actions surrounding 2 decks - list cards and action cards. An action is pick up a card, play a card or merge 2 lists (making one bigger list you can then mail to). The action cards consist of scams, mail-outs or hardware cards. Hardware cards are played in front of you and allow you to break the game rules in a prescribed way (eg can mail other's private lists). Mail-out cards also list special effects which vary from mundane to wildly powerful but generally allow you to hose other players. When you play one, you say whether you're mailing or playing the special effect.&#10;&#10;To the game play itself. You try to get a mail-out going every turn (you're only allowed one) and pick a scam / list combination that gives you the best chance of scoring 2 points rather than 1 point. If you only get 1 point, you may well be falling off the pace. You're generally picking up at least one card each turn, and this can be a slow process as any special action needs to be read and understood to work out whether you want to use the card as a mail-out or for the special effect. So it's not the fastest game in the world. These hostage cards also make it a big hit the leader game. If you're going to make a dash for the lead have plenty of protection cards because you have to maintain your winning score for a full round before you win - everyone gets a shot at you.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11348.jpg,6,90,13,2,90,Spammers,90,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic11348_t.jpg,1998,"David Gatzmer,John Nephew,Jeff Tidball",Card Game,NA,Jeff Tidball,NA,NA,NA,"Atlas Games,Trident Game Studio",4.16362,105

1650,"Milton Bradley marketed this game as a tie-in with Ralph Bakshi's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; animated feature film. However, aside from the artwork and the piece names, the game only bears a superficial resemblance to either the movie or Tolkien's works.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a character from the Fellowship. The object of the game is to have that character cast a magic Ring into Mount Doom. Along the way from the Shire to their final destination, players have opportunities to pick up *several* Rings. These rings may be spent to get past opposing creatures. However, to win the game, a player must have at least one Ring when they reach Mount Doom.&#10;&#10;Cards allow a player to move 1-3 clear spaces ahead, to defeat Orcs or Nazgul, to bypass the various opposing creatures on the board, or to traverse mountain terrain, dictate movement. Cards are also useful for stealing rings from an opponent, relocating Nazgul on the board, and other functions. Each player has a hand of 5 cards with which to play the game.&#10;&#10;Die rolling comes into play for fighting Orcs, Nazgul, Shelob and Gollum when you don't have a card to defeat (or escape from) them, or to traverse the mountains. A special die tells players how many turns they will be bogged down in a mountain space once they enter it.&#10;&#10;Card and Ring management afford strategy opportunities, while the rules remain simple enough (and the game quick enough) to allow the game to be played by a wide variety of ages.

1656,"In this anti-smoking game, the players try to accumulate money while avoiding addiction to cigarettes.  At the start of the game, each player picks a profession likely to benefit from the smoking of others (Doctor, Undertaker, etc.) and then starts moving around the board.  If a player lands on an advertising space, there's a chance that he or she will begin smoking.  When a smoker ends up sharing a space with another player, there's a chance he'll pawn one of his brand habits to him.  The more a player smokes, the faster they advance on the Life-O-Metre, which ends with death.  The game ends once the first player dies (in the short game) or when only one player remains alive (in the longer game).&#10;&#10;The game is extremely simple to play and is filled with all kinds of horrible (but sometimes amusing) puns.  The game's claim that it has the power to cause smokers to quit and to discourage people from ever picking up the habit is rather questionable, but since it's easy enough to be played by young children, its anti-smoking message might actually be able to reach an audience that hasn't heard it all before.  Unfortunately, the game's simplicity may well work against it; for some players, once all the jokes have been heard (and there aren't all that many), there's really not much reason left to play the game.

In the darkest part of the night, the doppelganger kills the Archmage, triggering a spell that seals the castle until the monster is caught. Now, in the grand tradition of Clue, the six suspects must determine which one of them is the doppelganger: Regdar the Human Fighter, Tordek the Dwarf Fighter, Lidda the Halfling Rogue, Mialee the Elf Wizard, Ember the Human Monk or Nebin the Gnome Wizard.

All existing solitaire systems on the market have the player take one side for the entire game. Unfortunately this pits the player against a random system with poor strategic direction. In Peloponnesian War you get to play both sides, pitting yourself against the best you can offer. If the game system is winning, the player is forced to continue with the losing side. Success, on the other hand, will eventually force the player to change sides and recover the losing side's fortunes. The duration of the war and the player's performance determine victory.

If you always loved combat the best ... take The Challenge.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play:&#10;&#10;The player who rolled the high die goes first. Play moves clockwise around the table. The player can either challenge an opponent, pass, or declare a defensive turn.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;1) Challenge another character by using a Weapon Action Card, casting a spell (Advanced), using a magic item (Advanced) or using a thief skill (Advanced) from one of your characters against another character in another party. Both Character Cards involved are turned face-up (if they are not already). Then the defending player may retaliate with any appropriate card or pass. The challenging player may then continue by playing an appropriate Action Card or passing, followed by the defending player, etc., until both players have passed or one of the two characters involved in the challenge has died. After the challenge is resolved, the player whose tum it is can move one of his characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw from the Action Deck(s) until he has seven cards. The player that was defending in the challenge cannot discard, but can refill his hand up to seven. It is then the next player's tum.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;2) Pass - Do no actions, moving of characters, or discarding of cards.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#187;&#191;3) Defensive turn - You can't play any Action Card that directly affects another party. Play party Defensive Cards (Advanced), allocate Magic Cards (Advanced) to characters, move any number of characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw up to seven cards from either the Weapon Action deck or the Mystic Action deck (Advanced).

One set, used by the 'roof' player, has roofs on 6 of the 8 squares on each tile.  The other set, used by the 'plaza' player, has plazas on 6 of the 8 squares on each tile.

1706,"UFO is a low complexity abstract game themed on an alien invasion of Earth.  The alien player must land 5 of 8 available ships on Earth to win.  The Earth player, with only eight rockets, must defend or perish.  Movement is along orbital paths that form 7 concentric rings around the Earth.  Each player rolls two dice and moves one rocket or UFO the exact count of for each die.  In addition to the UFOs and Earth's rockets speeding around, the moon orbits the Earth destroying all in its path.  Combat is not dice based, rather players capture opponents pieces by landing on them by exact orbital move of one die.&#10;&#10;The advanced game adds dummy counters for the alien player and space stations for additional defence of Earth.&#10;&#10;It feels really more like an abstract strategy game, but Avalon Hill classified as a wargame simulation.&#10;&#10;The game consists of&#10;&#10;-two 8&quot; x 16&quot; map boards with 2 black plastic clips to hold together.&#10;-die cut counters (8 rockets, 5 space stations, 1 moon, 8 saucers, 12 decoy UFOs)&#10;-2 six sided dice &#10;-1 double sided page of rules.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 1&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic243327.jpg,2,30,12,2,30,UFO: Game of Close Encounters,30,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic243327_t.jpg,1976,NA,Science Fiction,NA,Tom Dalgliesh,NA,Aliens,Hex-and-Counter,"Avalon Hill,Gamma Two Games",4.81826,115

1710,"Published by Avalon Hill in 1989 (for the Third edition).&#10;&#10;(from MMP's web site:)&#10;&#10;It is 70 A.D.  Dawn breaks on the combined might of four Legions arrayed on the heights of Mount Scopus, starting their methodical advance across the valley to the ancient walled city of Jerusalem.  Siege lines have been secured tight about the city.  There is no hope of escape.  The besieged must persist behind their stout walls or perish before a vengeful Rome.  Five grueling years of campaigning in Judea is now culminating in the Siege of Jerusalem.&#10;&#10;But the fortified city defies even the might of Rome.  The thick walls atop the steep slopes literally bristle with natural and manmade fortifications.  It will take all of Rome's considerable engineering skills to winch their war machines into position for an assault up the slopes to the city.  Only here in the north plain can the city's walls be taken by escalade.  The rhythmic approach of the Legions is muted by the rumble of the siege engines as an assortment of towers, rams, and artillery precede the maniples.  The distant walls seethe with the frenzied activity of an alerted populace as the antagonists draw near.  This majestic view is abruptly halted by the blare of trumpets which soon gives way to the cacophony of the clash of arms and screams of the dying.&#10;&#10;Morning turns to dusk before the walls are breached and the weary legions exact their vengeance.  The sky turns bright again, aglow in the reflection of a thousand fires as the northern outskirts burn.  But what price victory?  Another day such as this will break the Roman Army and only one of the city's ten walled sections has fallen this day.  They will have to find another way.  Shafts must be dug to undermine the walls or earthen ramps built with which to scale them.  It will be a long campaign.&#10;&#10;This is The Siege of Jerusalem...An epic battle simulation with all the trappings and majesty of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular.  Facing the greatest army of antiquity, the Judeans must rely on the stoutness of their walls to halt the unbeatable Roman legions and therein lies the fascination:  the immovable object vs the unstoppable force.  As Eliezar Ben Yair, leader of the Zealots, you must conduct a skilled defense of the city's ever shrinking perimeter - exacting from the Romans a price so terrible that they will be forced to lift their siege - or break out to continue your struggle for freedom at Massada.  As Titus, commander of the Roman army, you must decide when, where and how to renew the assault - gauging your troop needs against the progress of your siege works and the press of time caused by outside threats.  More than just conducting tactical combat, the Roman must formulate an overall strategic plan for the conduct of the siege.&#10;&#10;Vastly revised from its 1st &amp; 2nd edition printing from Historical Perspectives in the 70's, Siege of Jerusalem now boasts two-sided counters, a continuous combat system, a strategic interphase for conducting the entire siege, and the morale / panic rules so important in portraying ancient warfare.  An Introductory Scenario depicting the abortive assault of Gallus with the XII Legion three years previous allows players to learn how to handle a legion in a single day's play while training for eventual participation in the conduct of the epic siege.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic252228.jpg,2,300,12,1,300,The Siege of Jerusalem (Third Edition),300,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic252228_t.jpg,1989,"Charles Kibler,George I.

1712,"In the game, players take on the roles of theatre managers and must hire performers that will bring in the most money from the public.  There are six different styles of performers, and at different times in the game, public opinion will favour different styles.  Public preference is determined by dealing out cards from a special deck.  The current opinion is always known, and a possible (but not necessarily accurate) forecast of future preferences is also provided.&#10;&#10;Each turn, public opinion changes (sometimes to match the forecast, and sometimes into something completely random), then players use a bidding system to acquire contracts with performers.  Once contracts have been negotiated, profit is calculated depending on how well performers match the public's desires.&#10;&#10;By the time twelve turns have been played (and possibly one or two turns sooner), the game will come to an end and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published by the designer in 1985.

1714,"First was published Corona (1974). Moonstar added planets and variants (variant number 8 is Corona, without sand timer). Orbit is new game from 1993. Harun is not new game, it is a rethemed copy of Moonstar! Finally, Randolph recycled most of the game into his Rasenden Robotern (Ricochet Robots) , although the course mechanism and the objective were completely changed.&#10;&#10;Quite possibly the first &quot;German&quot; game to cross the Atlantic...&#10;&#10;About the game (from the back of the box)&#10;&#10;Moonstar is a game unlike any other game for any number of people. All the action is governed by dice, yet there is no luck involved. The dice simply establish the situation. It is up to the players to act upon it. A game with endless variety.&#10;&#10;Playable by any number of people, from one to a hundred, Moonstar combines numbers calculations, memory, and quick-thinking into a fast-playing, action-packed, exciting contest of pure skill.&#10;&#10;The board represents the twelve constellations (stars) of the Zodiac and the playing pieces represent moons and planets. Each game consists of a number of rounds of play. In each round, the board and playing pieces are first setup by one of the players. Then the dice are thrown. A one-minute auction period begins. Each player may bid any number of times in the auction or not at all. Each bid, however, must be higher than the previous one. When the one-minute runs out, the highest bidder plays that round.&#10;&#10;The play of the round also lasts one minute. A player plays a round by placing one die on each moon on the, board and then moving that moon (and die) a number of stars equal to the number of the die. The die is then removed and the moon may not be moved again. This procedure is followed for each moon. The player must move each moon before the time runs out, or those moons which have not been moved may not move.&#10;&#10;The player's score is then totaled to see if he has made his bid, by scoring a number of points for each moon, depending on which stars and planets they have landed on, If a player makes his bid, he scores a number of points equal to his bid. If he fails, he scores nothing. Rounds are setup and played in this manner until one player has scored enough points to win.&#10;&#10;But this is only the beginning. Moonstar is actually twelve games in one. Game One is simply the Basic Game. Games Two-Twelve each change one or more parts of Game One, or add something to it. They introduce things like challenging bids, side bets, more moons, more dice, different planet values, no planets. and advanced scoring methods.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;&#10;    16&quot; x 16&quot; gameboard&#10;    15 moon pieces&#10;    21 planet pieces&#10;    1 minute sand timer&#10;    11 6-sided dice&#10;    rulebook&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Corona&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Orbit&#10;    Ricochet Robots&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296897.jpg,12,30,12,2,30,Moonstar,30,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296897_t.jpg,1981,"Jean Baer,Margaret Lehman,Mark Wheatley","Abstract Strategy,Dice",NA,Alex Randolph,NA,NA,"Auction/Bidding,Betting/Wagering,Dice Rolling",Avalon Hill,5.0868,75

1718,"From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;At last - a money game for adults!&#10;&#10;Be forewarned!  This game might not be for you...unless you are a student of the international money market.  Or, you are just plain curious as to why the US dollar is worth less and less despite the fact that we are still the strongest nation in the world.&#10;&#10;Simply put, Foreign Exchange is not a toy.&#10;&#10;A perfect simulation of the international currency situation, it is!&#10;&#10;International companies realize gains and losses when changing currency rates alter the value of their income and assets in foreign countries.  This game simulates this situation by letting players own and manage multi-national companies in various cities throughout the world.  As in the real world, changing conditions require each player to make constant decisions after considering his company's financial resources - and what he expects his opponents to make - against the cost of alternative protective strategies.&#10;&#10;The Iranian oil situation of early '79 is a classic real-life example.  Iran furnishes less than 7% of America's petroleum needs.  Yet its unavailability has done more to devalue the dollar against gold than any economic crises since the depression of 1939. Why so, you may ask.&#10;&#10;Playing Foreign Exchange will give you insight into this question, and you'll have fun doing so because the game focuses on the interplayer relationships.  Without such interplay relationships, no game is fun to play.  With it, Foreign Exchange might just be the greatest money game to come along since Monopoly.&#10;&#10;Ironically, it doesn't come with any money.  All financial transactions are recorded on a variety of accounting pads included.  If you're into pencils, you'll love this game (some enterprising money -market enthusiasts have already programmed this game on computer).&#10;&#10;You - as company head - decide where in the world (literally) you want to establish sales and manufacturing offices.  This is done at the beginning through a round of trading City Cards among players until everyone is satisfied they've outsmarted their opponents.&#10;&#10;From this point on, a variety of situations and happenstances will determine likely changes in currency rates.  You - the manufacturer - must plan the strategies you think best to maximize gains.&#10;&#10;Foreign Exchange was designed by a professional money-management expert and executive officer of the leading financial institution.  What is duck soup to him, however, might be unfathomable to the novice.  That's why the game comes in three versions: a &quot;Beginning&quot; version for game buffs intrigued by money games; the &quot;Intermediate&quot; game for those with a cursory knowledge of what's going on with foreign currency; and the &quot;Expert&quot; game for those people who really have a yen for this sort of thing.&#10;&#10;Includes:&#10;2-piece fold-out game board&#10;Foreign Exchange Worksheet pad&#10;Net Worth Worksheet pad&#10;Hedging Cost Worksheet pad&#10;24 City Cards&#10;4 Borrowing Cost cards&#10;16 Currency Exchange cards&#10;16 Risk cards&#10;5 player tokens&#10;40 colored markers for 4 different colors&#10;2 6-sided dice&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296860.jpg,4,60,12,2,60,Foreign Exchange,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1296860_t.jpg,1979,NA,Economic,NA,Allan Tech,NA,NA,Commodity Speculation,"Avalon Hill,Gamma Two Games,Teck Enterprises",4.33651,63

The game features scenarios set chronologically in the fictional distant future setting: from the civil wars of the fledgling Human space empire, to the first alien invasion by the Droves, and the confrontation and eventual alliance between the Humans and the Rhylsh.&#10;&#10;The Droves and the Human/Rhylsh factions have different technologies between them, affecting the way their units move and the weapons they have to destroy each other with.  Both sides can deploy fighters, assault ships, destroyers, carriers, battle cruisers, and various other vessels.  Mines can be laid to defend outposts and star bases, but can be swept aside with mine sweepers.  Cargo can be captured, and sensors can be jammed to help cloaked ships infiltrate further.&#10;&#10;Each scenario (battle) is resolved as follows.  In the first phase, each player secretly writes down the movement and actions of his units.  The orders of both sides are then simultaneously resolved in the following phases.  After the moves and actions have been resolved, the players repeat the cycle, secretly plotting their orders and openly enacting them.  Combat actions are resolved by rolling dice and consulting the effects from tables.  Play goes on until the scenario's duration has elapsed or a side's Victory Conditions have been met.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic265323.jpg,3,120,12,2,120,Alpha Omega,120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic265323_t.jpg,1977,Mike Williford,"Science Fiction,Wargame",NA,"Sean Hayes,J.

Both the Church and the monastic Parkover Brothels deny the authenticity of the game.  As one official noted, &quot;that's a crock&quot;.&#10;&#10;Bureaucracy is designed to simulate the bureaucratic behavior which constitutes so much of what we call government.  It is convoluted, Byzantine, and entertaining.  It is also cost effective, feasible, and administratively impossible.  In its early stages, Bureaucracy required a fifteen story parlor, a six acre gameboard, 200,000 pieces, and a 15,000 page rulebook.  Of course, this prototype was unwieldy.  Consequently, we were forced to simplify the game.  The present version is good for two to eight players.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game at the lowest organizational level.  The winner is the player who rises up through the masses to become the Director of the Bureaucracy.&#10;&#10;Players may select one of four lifestyles, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: lifer, over achiever, empire builder, or hustler.  To be promoted from level to level, a player will need the required number of promotional prerequisites and that's where the fun comes in.  All sorts of things can happen.  Players may be demoted.  They may be involved in scandals.  They may become involved in power plays.  They may have to go before a Grievance Committee.  A player may even go bankrupt and have to start all over from the bottom again.  There is no one sure formula for success.  Players will have to stay out of trouble and use all their cunning to succeed.&#10;&#10;This is a game that makes being a part of the bureaucracy fun  It will make you laugh at government and yourself at the same time.    For civil servants, it's required recreation.  For just you and me, it's a must.  Don't be surprised though, when you open the box and hear the call of the jungle.

Since foreign presences are essentially mutually exclusive, a lot of shouldering aside goes on. Control of non-player states scores points, as well as consumer goods factories. Military bases don't score anything, but they protect your influence over another country.&#10;&#10;The players accumulate chips representing their overall power on the military, industrial or political spheres, and use those chips to exert pressure on other players. For example, you can &quot;demand&quot; that a player withdraw his steel mills from a country you consider to be &quot;yours&quot; by paying a chip (of any colour). The other player either complies or counters with a chip of his own. This can escalate until either player buckles.

But, this last Monday, he did not show up for a gathering to which his friends had invited him. Tintin, the famous reporter, and Captain Haddock, the old sea-wolf, knew that, since the previous week, rumours abounded about the Professor&rsquo;s invention. They went to his laboratory, accompanied by Milou, Tintin&rsquo;s dog, and the detectives Dupond and Dupont, summoned in great haste. Once there, traces of a struggle were found that indicated that, without a doubt, the Professor had been kidnapped! Speculation is that the kidnappers intended to wrest the secret of his invention from the Professor.&#10;Immediately, Tintin and his friends launched themselves in pursuit of the kidnappers.&#10;&#10;The players move on the board trying to gather as much information as possible. They are trying to find out in which house Professor Tournesol is being held, and by whom.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds by elimination of possibilities, as one must rule out all other possible houses and suspects before reaching a conclusion. For example, the proof-cards (orange backed cards) show the following objects: a hat, sunglasses, a mustache, a crowbar and shoes.

1735,"Evade is an old (1971) 3M game, part of their  series of 'Gamettes', games which were released in very small, fold-over bookcase type boxes.  There were 9 games in this series, which were released near the end of the 3M venture into the gaming market.&#10;&#10;The game is extremely simple, yet requires quite a bit of 'bluffing' in order to win.  Each player begins with six metal pawns along the back row of a 6x6 grid.  The board fits snuggly into the box itself and is quite sturdy.  The game is, as is the entire Gamette series, ideal for bringing along while traveling.&#10;&#10;Each player secretly places a teeny magnet under two of his pawns.  The object is to be the first player to maneuver one of these 'magnet-bearing' pawns to the opposite side of the board.  If you manage to accomplish this feat, you win.&#10;&#10;Movement is simple.  You simply move one of your pawns one space to an adjacent space ... vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  If this lands you atop an opponent's pawn, you are both 'frozen' and can no longer move.  If you make the mistake of moving one of your 'magnet' pawns onto an opponent, he instantly wins.  &quot;Well&quot;, you say, &quot;Why wouldn't I just check the pawn to make sure it wasn't carrying a magnet before making such a questionable move?&quot;.  The rules allow for this, but if you do check, you are prohibited from 'freezing' an opponent that round.  So, it's best to remember which two of your pawns are carrying magnets.&#10;&#10;As mentioned, the game ends as soon as one player manages to get a magnet-bearing pawn to the opposite side of the board.  If both players fail to accomplish this, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;The game is very simple and the primary tactic is 'bluff'.  Are you going to be bold and move one of your 'magnet' pawns to the front, figuring your opponent will guess that this cannot possibly be your magnet pawn as he could freeze it too easily?  Or, do you protect your magnet pawns and try to create a path that it can squeeze by your opponent's pawns and scoot to the opposite side?  As with most bluff-style games, there's some guesswork and plain old luck involved, but there is still enough maneuvering and tactics to keep it interesting.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic171975.jpg,2,10,12,2,10,Evade,10,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic171975_t.jpg,1971,NA,Abstract Strategy,NA,Alex Randolph,NA,3M Gamettes,NA,3M,5.72982,57

The computer game version is notably considered the forerunner of the Heroes of Might and Magic series of computer and video games. A sequel to the original computer game, called King's Bounty: The Legend was released in 2008.&#10;&#10;The computer game's origin began with fighting mechanics that were meant to have a similar flavor to that of the Avalon Hill board game Titan, but the computer game lacked a story-line or theme. At the same time as this computer development, the author of the King's Bounty board game was wrapping up the development of the board game, which at the time had a working title of &quot;Bounty Hunter.&quot; New World Computing decided to adopt a storyline and theme similar to that of the board game being prepared for production by Task Force Games, which New World Computing owned.&#10;&#10;New World Computing shut down development at Task Force Games and transferred ownership of the company prior to the board game production completing, which delayed its release. The major remaining component that had to be completed prior to release was final production and layout of the rule book, which is why interior artwork changed from that produced for other components. The cover graphic, already completed and originally contracted for the board game and then adopted by the computer game, remained unchanged.

1816,"An abstract race game set on the Mississippi river. Each person has a boat (actually a hexagonal piece with the numbers 1-6 written on each of the 6 sides of the piece). The board is a long track of hexes that wind back and forth in an 'S' pattern. Each person places his 'boat' on the start space with one of the numbers facing forwards. Each person also starts with a number of 'Logs'. These are used to move your boat forward 1 space for each log spent. (You can also decide to move backwards - gaining 1 log for each space moved back).&#10;&#10;Now comes the complication - bumping. If your boat stops in a space that is adjacent to 1 or more others, bumping occurs. To determine where your boat ends up you look at the hex sides facing each other (on your boat and on the adjacent one(s)). You subtract the adjacent boat's hex side number from yours - and if it is positive your boat moves forward that number of spaces, and if negative - the other boat moves forward that number of spaces. Now you check to see if your boat is adjacent to another boat and if so repeat the bumping procedure.&#10;&#10;If your boat is next to more than 1 boat, and has at least 1 positive difference, your boat moves forward. If you have more than 1 positive, add them together and move forward that distance. If you have a negative difference the other boats move in clockwise order.&#10;&#10;For subsequent turns - you can freely change the facing (&amp; thus the hex side number facing forward) by 60 degrees. Moving it further than 1 hexside costs you 1 &quot;log&quot; per extra 60 degree facing change. You then decide whether to move forward or back and resolve any bumping.&#10;&#10;The first boat to the finish wins.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic335991.jpg,6,45,10,2,45,Mississippi,45,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic335991_t.jpg,1987,Dietmar Keidel,"Abstract Strategy,Nautical,Racing",NA,Roland Siegers,NA,NA,Dice Rolling,Mattel,5.80379,132
1817,"Second in the seemingly choose-random-words-for-a-plot Devil Bunny series, the idea behind this game is, frighteningly enough:&#10;&#10;You and your friends are honest, hard working taffy pulling machines working in Devil Bunny's taffy factory.  Devil Bunny hates the Earth, for reasons best left known to people who bother to think about such things, and has decided to have his revenge by releasing upon this world the most unsatisfying brand of saltwater taffy known to man.  You and your friends have devised a way to stop him, however.  By luring cute and cuddly little squirrels into the factory and getting them to gum up your works (presumably doing unpleasant things to the squirrel, too) you think you might be able to break yourself, thus foiling Devil Bunny's plot.  Sure, it's a half baked idea, but you're taffy pulling machines, not scientists.  Besides, Devil Bunny's plot isn't likely to succeed anyway.&#10;&#10;The game focuses on distribution of tokens (representing squirrels) in a linear fashion eventually leading to your machine.  However, on certain rolls of the dice, Devil Bunny will come out onto the board and repair (remove tokens from) a machine.

It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control.&#10;&#10;Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians.

1823,"1829 was the first of the 18xx series. First published in the mid-'70s it was way ahead of its time. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains &amp; generate revenue for shareholders.&#10;&#10;This basic system has been much copied and is an integral part of all 18xx games.&#10;&#10;The original board covered the southern half of Britain, from the south coast to Darlington. In 1981 a northern board was published covering northern Britain &amp; Scotland.&#10;&#10;Where 1829 differs from most others in the 18xx series is the means by which track is laid. Companies each have a token on the board called a Survey Party. Track is laid by moving the company's Survey token and placing a track tile in the area just vacated... if it is still vacant. This mechanism was discarded in the later 18xx titles, and creates much more of a tactical tile-laying game. It also slows down the game, and 1829 is one of the longer 18xx titles. A typical game can take anything from 4 to 10 hours to play.&#10;&#10;In 1994 Francis Tresham published 1825, which is largely a modular version of 1829 with simpler rules and a few other enhancements. It plays quite differently from 1829, though, as 1829 was always about competition for routes.&#10;&#10;The board gaming hobby has in its history a few landmark games, which redefine a part of board games in general, or even spawn an entire genre. 1829 is just such a landmark.&#10;&#10;Expanded By:&#10;&#10;    MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)&#10;    MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)&#10;    1829 Conversion Kit&#10;    1829 Northern Board&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic224206.jpg,9,360,12,3,360,1829,360,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic224206_t.jpg,1974,NA,"Economic,Trains,Transportation",NA,Francis Tresham,"1829 Conversion Kit,MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards),MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards),MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards),MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards),MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)",18xx,"Commodity Speculation,Route/Network Building,Stock Holding",Hartland Trefoil Ltd.,7.0493,200

And they did not have to wait long - in fact, far too short to build up the RAF to a strength that would be able to match the German Luftwaffe. But besides its fighters, the RAF has other weapons to help deal with the &quot;Huns&quot;: a chain of RDF (radar) towers along the British coast, and an elaborate system of communications, signal evaluation and fighter control and guidance. If those are used skilfully, the resulting economy of Fighter Command operations might just be able to offset the sheer power of the German Luftflotten (&quot;air fleets&quot;).&#10;&#10;You are in command of all four RAF Fighter Groups to match them against the incoming raids.

1861,"Dragonfire was an attempt by Target/Heartbreaker to entice young adults into roleplaying, by means of devising a crossover between a roleplaying game and a fantasy miniatures boardgame similar to Milton Bradley and Games Workshop with their Hero Quest game system. This boxed game consists of 16 miniatures, various room and corridor tiles, cardboard doors with stand-ups, and some dungeon dressings represented by die cut cardboard pieces. The aim is to complete the task of each scenario given in the scenario booklet. One player is the Dungeon Master and sets up the rooms and monsters within when the other players reach them; the instructions are very specific about how to place the monsters, traps or items they encounter. Players are cooperative and do not compete against each other. Of course the players won't see the adventure booklet in advance or during the game, only the game master. All the players are knights of different colors (red, blue, green, and yellow). The same four colors are used for the plastic miniatures of: 4 orcs with bows, 4 trolls with clubs, and 4 Dragon Lords with swords.&#10;Between each scenario may the players increase their rank, depending on how many points they have collected during the scenario. They get points depending on which monsters they have killed plus one extra for a successfully done scenario. In the Dungeons are there monsters, traps, magic items and other stuff. Overall, the designers do a decent job of making the scenarios entertaining given a limited amount material in the game. Each turn, a new event card is overturned and strange things take place. This is fun at first but becomes predictable in later games.&#10;The dicing and combat system uses colored dice with different probabilities of scoring a hit - similar to Heroquest's Skulls and shields except that they are just circles on the dice and represent more of a yes/no answer when rolling. The game is slightly more advanced than Heroquest in that players can advance in levels similar to dungeons and dragons. As you increase in levels, you switch color of dice when attacking and defending, thus increasing your chances to score a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;hit&quot; result on the dice. Otherwise the game is very similar to HeroQuest in general.&#10;Heartbreaker Hobbies produced a couple of lead elf miniatures designed for use with Dragonfire. At the same time, they put out a rare poster/magazine called &quot;Symmetry&quot; #1 that included two new magic items for the game, stats for two elf characters, and a short scenario using all of this with the Dragonfire game. One would assume that consumer response was lacking given that no attention was given to the Dragonfire game in later issues of Symmetry and the game went into obscurity. Still, the game could be used for a couple of night's gaming, especially if introducing children to D&amp;D style gaming or if one wanted to pirate the minis and room pieces to use with other game systems.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic75823.jpg,5,60,9,3,60,Dragonfire,60,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic75823_t.jpg,1992,"Håkan Ackegård,Ken Kelly","Adventure,Fantasy",NA,"Nils Gulliksson,Olle Sahlin,Henrik Strandberg",NA,Animals: Dragons,"Co-operative Play,Modular Board,Role Playing","Borras Plana S.A.,Casper,Heartbreaker,Target Games",5.88421,57

1873,"Component Game Systems came out with a number of component game systems that used the same sort-of-collectible approach (a roughly similar game is Space Race). Besides Babylon 5, there was Hercules, Xena, and Star Trek. The Babylon 5 game was apparently derived from the unpublished Galactic Empires board game, based on the CCG of the same name --Companion Games (Galactic Empires' publisher) became Component Game Systems in the process.&#10;&#10;The basic idea is that each player need only buy his part of the game, representing in this case a specific political entity from the Babylon 5 universe. Players sit down at the same table and put their components in common to have a game. Pretty cool.&#10;&#10;In the Babylon 5 game, you take control of a certain faction which is trying to gain power in the galaxy. You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.&#10;&#10;You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are &#10;different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs. You can create decks for each player as per CCGs, or you can just draw from a common deck after handing out the empire specific cards.&#10;&#10;Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.&#10;&#10;The game does a very good job of recreating the B5 universe, with play action matching pretty closely the series' happenings. In terms of mechanics, it is similar to Twilight Imperium and Les Cochons de l'espace.&#10;&#10;There are two core sets, although CGS initially intended five (one for each of the show's seasons). They are the 2258 and 2259 Core Sets. The first was published in two formats, the 1997 first printing (Limited Edition; CB5-101) using a smaller, unimpressive box (they were in a hurry to get it to the store shelves by Christmas of that year), whilst the 1998 second printing (CB5-001) came in a beautiful large box (allowing room for the storage of extra sets) labeled as &quot;Babylon 5: The Board Game&quot;. The 2259 Core Set (CB5-102) was only published in the big box format. The core sets include the Earth Alliance, Narn Regime, Centauri Republic and Minbari factions, which were each available separately (although the core sets include some extra cards and stuff beyond the combination of the four individual Starter Kits). There is supposedly enough difference between the 2258 and 2259 core sets to warrant buying both, although I haven't received my 2259 set yet so I can't be sure.&#10;&#10;Component Game Systems has now disappeared from the face of the earth, and even their domain name (www.c-g-s.com) has been recycled by some unrelated outfit.&#10;&#10;Part of the Component Game System.&#10;&#10;",//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic103079.jpg,4,120,10,2,120,Babylon 5 Component Game System: Core Sets,120,//cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic103079_t.jpg,1997,NA,"Card Game,Economic,Exploration,Movies / TV / Radio theme,Negotiation,Political,Science Fiction,Wargame",NA,"George T.
